What’s so doesn’t care what you think, feel, intend or wish; it will not bend. You can be freaked out or driven over what’s so, and it won’t change what’s so. If you’re late for an appointment, getting freaked out about it won’t have you arrive any earlier. If you’re having a bad day, being freaked out won’t change what’s so.\n\nThat which you seek will not bring you satisfaction – aligning with what’s so will.\n\nWhen you’re upset, you’re never upset over what’s so. What’s so is just what’s so, and you’re upset.\n\nIf your house burns down and you get upset, does it bring your house back? What’s so doesn’t care if you’re upset; it’s up to you how you handle what’s so. There is no confusion in what’s so. When you don’t know you just don’t know – there is no confusion there.\n\nThere’s nothing right or wrong about what’s so. What’s so is always open to different interpretations. There’s always just what’s so, and then you have an interpretation.\n\nWhat scares you isn’t what’s so, it’s your interpretation. The interpretation is never true; what’s so is real, the interpretation is not.\n\nWho you’re being is just who you’re being, and what’s so doesn’t care if you’re happy with it or not, so why should you? When you’re not being with what’s so, that’s also just what’s so. Why should you concern yourself?\n\nOther people should always be the way they’re being; if you think they shouldn’t, that’s your interpretation. Bring yourself back to what’s so about them. Until you can be with what’s so, you can’t be with anything or anyone. You may have control over other people’s what’s so, but none over their interpretation – give it up.\n\nIf you take action or not, it’s still just what’s so. If it works out well or not, it’s still just what’s so. You can never make a right or wrong decision or take a right or wrong action.\n\nWhatever you do will always bring you more of what’s so, and then you have an interpretation about it. Whatever you don’t have, so what? Whatever you’ve done or thought in the past, again so what? Whatever happens in the future is not to be feared. It’s just going to be more of what’s so.\n\nThe challenge is to spend as much time in what’s so as you can. The chatter in your head is more interpretation, and it has nothing to do with what’s so. There’s nothing wrong with the chatter, it’s just you listening to a fantasy.\n\nThe thought that there is something wrong is an illusion; there is nothing wrong, there is only what’s so.\n\nNotice when you’re comparing what’s so to some fantasy of how it should be. Bring yourself back to what’s so and it will be O.K.\n\nAsk yourself what’s so and align with that. Align with what’s so and it will not matter. That is the foundation of transformation and satisfaction.\n\nNot aligning with what’s so is the only thing that will ever bring you hardship or suffering. Life in what’s so will bring you harmony, grace, and balance.\n\nThe other side of what is so is so what.\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var l=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var y=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var c=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var p=(e,t)=\u003e()=\u003e(t||e((t={exports:{}}).exports,t),t.exports),f=(e,t)=\u003e{for(var n in t)a(e,n,{get:t[n],enumerable:!0})},h=(e,t,n,i)=\u003e{if(t\u0026\u0026typeof t==\"object\"||typeof t==\"function\")for(let s of d(t))!g.call(e,s)\u0026\u0026s!==n\u0026\u0026a(e,s,{get:()=\u003et[s],enumerable:!(i=y(t,s))||i.enumerable});return e};var b=(e,t,n)=\u003e(n=e!=null?l(c(e)):{},h(t||!e||!e.__esModule?a(n,\"default\",{value:e,enumerable:!0}):n,e)),m=e=\u003eh(a({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),e);var u=p((T,r)=\u003e{r.exports=_jsx_runtime});var W={};f(W,{default:()=\u003ej});var o=b(u());function w(e){let t=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",p:\"p\"},e.components);return(0,o.jsxs)(o.Fragment,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.h1,{id:\"whats-so-by-werner-erhard\",children:\"What\\u2019s So by Werner Erhard\"}),`\n`,(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:\"What\\u2019s so is always just what\\u2019s so.
