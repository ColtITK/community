Together, we will restore faith in humanity.\n\n### History\n\nHistory can be found in https://medium.com/@purehouse (note posts are very recent June-July 2017 so believe that stuff is happening now).\n\nFrom https://medium.com/@purehouse/our-story-827fb597d179\n\n> Born in Brooklyn in 2012, Pure House was conceived by accident. It all started as an experiment to curate passionate creatives and entrepreneurs as roommates. I wanted to create a nurturing environment for them to thrive. We would share healthy meals, go to yoga together and hit the occasional morning ecstatic dance party. The idea really caught on and there was way more interest than we had rooms. So I decided to take another apartment and expand the community. And so Pure House was born as a modern experiment in communal living. Never intended as a business, this beautiful experiment continued to expand to 25 apartments and 65 residents.\n>\n> The media eventually caught on and after the New York Times did a feature story in the Sunday Real Estate section, things started to get really crazy. After dozens of interviews, it became apparent that we were part of a nascent movement being referred to as co-living. Eventually, it was clear that we were a precursor for this movement.\n> \n> By 2015, having tested and iterated upon dozens of ideas, we had learned many things; most significantly of which was the realization that our prototype needed to evolve. We were most interested in understanding the drivers of this movement and how we could apply our experience to support others in developing their co-living (ad)ventures.\n>\n> In November 2016, we set up Pure House Lab as a Paris-based non-profit co-living network to conduct research, connect our members to opportunities and consult on the development of co-living projects. Our methodology focuses through the lenses of community, space, model, policy, communications and services.\n>\n> We are currently building coliving.city as a on/offline content platform for the global co-living sector. We will host a series of events around the globe to foster conversation among the active stakeholders building co-living organizations. We will also publish content that presents both a broad and detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities that are faced by this nascent sector.\n\n### The Lab\n\nThey seem to have spun most of their energy into a Pure House Lab which is a non-profit doing consulting and partnerships on coliving (but not developing);\n\nhttp://www.purehouselab.org/\n\n> PUREHOUSE LAB is an ecosystem and do-tank dedicated to informing and enabling the spread of the co-living phenomenon worldwide.\n>\n> Information and ideas proliferate through our partner and member network and our six forums: Community, Space, Policy, Models, Communications, and Services & Tools.\n>\n> We enable the establishment of co-living ventures by connecting entrepreneurs, operators, investors and experts to spaces and to one another. This fosters collaboration that leads to the launch of new co-living experiences.\n\nThey have a lot of partners including most folks in the co-living and digital nomad space.\n\n","code":"var
