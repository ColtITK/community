Any misinterpretations are my responsibility.\n\n- We need an \"onto-shift\" in philanthropy (and in general): a shift not just in what we do but how we see and be in the world.\n- Philanthropy is deeply enmeshed in the capitalist neoliberal system\n  - 2 levels:\n    * 1) almost all the money comes from capitalists and the capitalist system (often the worst kind e.g. monopolists and robber barons)\n    - 2) philanthropy often acts as justification or whitewash for capitalist exploitation e.g. a monopoly capitalist makes a lot of money in dubious ways and then heals their image (and justifies the greater system) by giving lots of money away (e.g. Rockefeller, Gates etc). Specifically here, there gross inequalities of capitalism are intimately connected to the philanthropic enterprise -- without the inequality there would be no philanthropy.\n  - there is also a deeper level at the ideological level: philanthropy often shares much of the capitalist neoliberal worldview even in sectors that seem more progressive (let alone those which are explicitly neoliberal or libertarian focused) [Ed: i would say more even the \"modernist\" worldview]. More strongly, given point (1) above it is not surprising that many philanthropies are explicitly or implicitly enthusiastic supporters of the status quo (no-one wants to think that what they achieved was unfair or unjustified -- or, conversely, we all want to think that what we achieved or received was fair and justified). For example:\n    - blindspot about the systemic source (connected to capitalism) of many of the issues e.g. unequal access to education, healthcare etc etc. At best, the \"losers\" (poor, victims of racism etc) are unlucky, at worst it is their \"fault\" (directly e.g. laziness or indirectly e.g. bad inherited attitudes). \n    - Attitudes like \"value for money\" and focus on measurable results similar to those in for profit enterprises (profit simply renamed to impact)\n    - ideas and approaches that involve \"choice\", \"markets\", \"scalability\", \"entrepreneurship\" etc\n    - client / customer relationship between philanthropist and grantee\n- This is especially problematic because of the (increasingly) powerful role that philanthropy (plus the big agencies e.g. World Banke etc) play in civil society: in many countries most organizations will depend or seek philanthropic funding and thus must accommodate themselves to the dominant philanthropic worldview.\n- Yes, of course, we can use the \"master's tools to dismantle the master's house [and build a new one]\". However, very few philanthropies are doing this explicitly or implicitly. You don't see e.g. the Gates Foundation saying: \"Oh yes, we acknowledge that the route by which this wealth was accumulated is part of a dysfunctional system that needs profound change and we are going to dedicate all of these resources to effecting that kind of change\"\n\n## Comments / thoughts\n\n- would have been useful to compare philanthropy vs government. Suspect government spends more and has more influence on civil society than philanthropy.\n  - cf (p.84) \"However, what is unique about philanthropy is the disproportionate power it has as a sector, largely determining the activities and parameters of civil society, actively reinforcing the status quo, all the while receiving the benefits of directing public funds, including tax breaks and social legitimacy.\"\n- *quite* green\n  - Example: \"there are no hierarchies\" type view e.g. they quote \"There are no hierarchies in nature other than those imposed by hierarchical modes of human thought, but rather differences merely in function between and within living things.\"\" Murray Bookchin176\n  - \"As we move from the hierarchical, exploitative relations of pyramid logic to the biomimetic approach of spiral logic, we will continue the ecological metaphor of expanding circles of relationality.\" p. 151\n- Would have liked to see more raw interview context: these quotes were often the most interesting part.\n\n## Appendix: To follow up on\n\n- Hospicing Modernity: Facing Humanity's Wrongs and the Implications for Social Activism. By Vanessa Machado de Oliveira. Note connection in name with requiem project.\n\n# Excerpts and Commentary\n\nTwo parts:\n\n- PART ONE: INTO THE PARADOX\n- PART TWO: FROM PARADOX TO EMERGING POSSIBILITIES\n\n# INTO THE PARADOX\n\n# THE FIRST HIERARCHY - GLOBAL NEOLIBERAL OPERATING SYSTEM\n\n### Capitalism is the problem\n\n\u003e We have already crossed six of the nine planetary boundaries (including climate change, biodiversity loss, land-use change, biogeochemical flows, chemical pollution and fresh water change) and we are already in the midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction with over 200 species a day going extinct, a thousand times the baseline rate of extinction.56 How could we even fathom continuing to grow the global economy 3% a year and consuming the way we currently do? What is the ideology at the root of the civilisational cancer of growth?\n\u003e\n\u003e The short answer is capitalism. In other words, a system that is organised around extracting and accumulating surplus value, and then reinvesting that capital for increased expansion through ever-more exploitation of human labour and the natural world. Of course, capitalism is not a static system. It is constantly morphing and mutating. In the 1980’s, the dominant form of capitalism became neoliberalism – an accelerated, globalised incarnation that purposefully deregulated the global economy, cheapened labour and expanded corporate control to keep the engine of growth going.\n\n\n### Neoliberalism is a snowball gathering steam down the mountain of history for 5000 years\n\n\u003e Think of neoliberalism as a snowball still gathering heft and momentum from a five- thousand year progression into ever more complex forms of hierarchy, patriarchy, monoculture, abstraction, ecocide and alienation. Every time we have chosen the expansion of capital over the living inputs in each accretion of capital, we helped expand the neoliberal snowball – even if we did so with the well-intentioned belief that the accretion of capital would support life in the long-run\n\nThis risks becoming somewhat one-sided in its presentation and tone. Surely there were some positive aspects of capitalism/neoliberalism progression beyond \"hierarchy, patriarchy, monoculture, abstraction, ecocide and alienation\"? Furthermore, projecting capitalism and/or neoliberalism onto the last five thousand years of history seems a stretch (were ancient egyptian's capitalist in the modern sense of the term?)\n\nSteel-manning: one way to read is that there are certainly ideological components of capitalism and neoliberalism that have their roots deep in human history and psyche e.g. a desire to accumulate, to possess, to control (something for which we have substantial evidence both intuitively, historically and scientifically). And these \"parts\" of ourselves have manifested in an especially virulent (and harmful) form into the memeplex called neoliberal capitalism.\n\n### The five major tenets of neoliberalism\n\nKey points on [[../notebook/ontology|Ontology]] and [[../notebook/culture|Culture]] of capitalism / modernity / neoliberalism.\n\n\u003e 1. Humans are inherently selfish and competitive.\n\u003e 2. Hierarchy is inevitable, and in fact, necessary for order.\n\u003e 3. The individual is the primary unit of power.\n\u003e 4. Material wealth and power determine well-being, meaning, life success and virtue.\n\u003e 5. Separation and materialism define our relationship with the world; and this reality can be understood rationally.\n\nIn detail:\n\n\u003e The dominant global ideology of neoliberalism has at least five major philosophical tenets.\n\u003e \n\u003e From the Enlightenment onwards, a core tenet of Western thought – which has been super-charged by neoliberalism – is that human beings are inherently egoistic and competitive by nature. This “human nature” defines our relationship to other beings through a competitive lens (e.g. am I better, richer, etc.). This worldview was mainstreamed through the logic derived from selective half-truths about the Darwinian theory of natural selection, the philosophies of David Hume and Thomas Hobbes, and the political economy of Adam Smith.59 Essentially, the belief dictates that we are all engaged in a battle for survival with other aggressive, survivalist humans who are “red in tooth and claw”.60\n\u003e \n\u003e The second is the belief that hierarchy is inevitable and, in fact, important for order. Without clear hierarchy and rule of law, society would descend into “mere anarchy” or a Hobbesian state of war. This belief justifies the nation-state, governments, war, taxation, constitutions and other laws. The ordering of this hierarchy is also sustained and perpetuated, as determined by God, genetics and superiority. The white male rests at the top of this hierarchy, embedded within a manifest destiny and supremacy as the “natural order” of the world.\n\u003e \n\u003e The third tenet is that the individual is the primary unit of power. As Margaret Thatcher, one of the key architects of neoliberalism summed it up: “...there’s no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first.”61\n\u003e \n\u003e The fourth pillar of neoliberalism is that material comfort, wealth and power equate to well-being, meaning, and life success – which are then equated to virtue. Therefore, rich people and powerful institutions are good, while poor or disenfranchised people are bad, lazy, irresponsible, inept or just need more ‘personal opportunities’.\n\u003e \n\u003e ...\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, the metaphysical aspect of neoliberalism states that separation from the natural world and materialism (i.e. that the world is made of fixed, separate material objects) define our relationship to the “outside”. We are separate, atomised beings battling Nature itself with the aim of conquest and domination. We ourselves are dualistically split between mind and body, our advanced, God-like nature and our mere physical shell. All of our interactions with the material world can be understood rationally through our unique and advanced minds. Homo economicus, the rational man, is the pinnacle of the human ideal, and therefore the pinnacle of all Life. As Descartes infamously stated: “I think therefore I am” (cogito ergo sum).63\n\nEd: fascinating presentation. On the one hand both agree with much here: both identification of these as core tenets *and* (the implicit claim) that these are erroneous. My hesitation is the (implicit pull) in the text that (at least to me as the reader) implies these are (simply) the consequence of neoliberalism -- rather than, say, also arising from \"deeper\" aspects of human nature or culture (or ideologies other than capitalism e.g. a strong argument that the separation from nature shows up in marxist traditions and is an aspect of modernity (and earlier, perhaps e.g. platonic thought etc).\n\nSee for example this exercise at the end of the section:\n\n\u003e How do the core tenets of neoliberalism play out in your day-to-day life? In your workplace; the organisations you interact with; your understanding of the role of government; your ways of engaging with family, community and society more broadly?\n\nMore generally, there is something of an irony that having talked about non-dualism and embodied cognition etc there is such a strong \"wrong-making\" of one particular approach and the groups associated with it (the 1%, the wealthy, the neoliberals, Thatcher etc). Don't we need to Thatcher in us? I miss a more sympathetic and nuanced tone. yes, there is much to be angry about (in one way) ... and this is a moment that needs so much compassion.\n\nIn this direction, what is there to recognize that was positive in capitalism, or even, neoliberalism? And to what extent are these simply dysfunctional elements of a onto-social paradigm that is exhausted (a dysfunctional \"orange\" if you like) -- a paradigm that may have (or once have had) positives?\n\n### Neoliberalism prioritizes private property over collective wealth and well-being\n\n\u003e Relatedly, neoliberalism prioritises private property over collective wealth and well-being, which in turn leads to what the late Harvard economist J.K. Galbraith described as “private affluence and public squalor” – manifesting in privatised benefits but socialised costs. This is not an externality, or unintended consequence, of capitalism.\n\nSurely (steel-manning neoliberalism) neoliberalism thesis is that private property is the *path* to collective wealth and well-being -- rather than that it *prioritizes* private property over collective wealth and well-being.\n\n### Neoliberalism is an institutional religion\n\nNeoliberalism is more akin to a theology than an economic ideology. It provides answers to the major inquiries or first principles of an institutional religion including:\n\nOntology – Selfishness and competition are our human nature, and this nature can only be regulated by a God-like invisible hand.\n\nEpistemology – Humans are masters of the material world, mediated by rational thought, in an upward march towards “progress”.\n\nEthics – The pursuit of self-interest, market growth and economic maximisation is the goal of individuals and society.\n\nCosmology – Humans are entitled to extract and conquer the natural world and other beings.\n\nMetaphysics – Humans are distinctly separate from the natural and special. Aesthetics – The human, especially the white male, holds the “objective gaze” of reality and beauty.\n\nPolitical philosophy – Hierarchically organised capitalist nation-states that compete through economic growth are the most ideal and efficient models to organise society.\n\n# THE SECOND HIERARCHY - PHILANTHROPY AS EXTENSION AND EXTERNALITY OF NEOLIBERALISM\n\n### Steven Rockefeller stating there is no rational justification in their wealth\n\n\u003e Having wealth is unjustified, but the Rockefellers justify it by doing good. I had to cut through all this and understand that there is no rational justification for my family having the amount of money that it has, and that the only honest thing to say in defence of it is that we like having the money and the present social system allows us to keep it.\n\u003e \n\u003e Steven Rockefeller\n\nSource: Kashtan, (November 25, 2016). This is a [psychology today article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/acquired-spontaneity/201611/you-re-not-bad-person-facing-privilege-can-be-liberating) that provides no further citation. Quick googling did not turn up anything.\n\n### Implausibly large and precise estimates for returns to corporate lobbying\n\n\u003e And then there’s the kicker: corporations often actively subvert democracy to further entrench their power and wealth. Research from Harvard’s Safra Center for Ethics shows that corporations receive up to $220 return on investment for every dollar invested in lobbying the United States Congress.91\n\nCitation is Lessig (2011), p.117. Have not examined this yet but seems very implausible from what i know of research in this area.\n\n### Colin Greer (President of New World Foundation - founded by McCormick heiress in 1954)\n\n\u003e Colin Greer, a long-time philanthropic practitioner and the president of the New World Foundation (a progressive funder based in New York), defined philanthropy as money thrice stolen: “The money is first stolen through the unfair, rigged lottery of cut-throat neoliberalism. Then it is stolen again by redirecting public money through significant tax breaks, supporting the ongoing expansion of the initial endowments which are largely invested in the very same extractive system. Then finally, these funds are ‘morally cleansed’ when a small portion of the funds go through the public enactment of supporting civil society, energetically, reputationally and physically extracting once more from the fabric of society to confer more power, intelligence, goodness, magnanimity, etc. upon the benevolent benefactors.”97 All the while, there is a steady imposition of conservative values, cultural tropes, mores, and norms on the grantees – those distant practitioners who must fit into philanthropic siloes and interest areas and undergo tedious applications, milestone reports, and other funder-imposed requirements, to create a “theatre of effective philanthropy” and to maintain good funder-grantee relations.\n\n### Philanthropy was $1.7 trillion sector in 2018\n\n\u003e In 2018, philanthropy as a sector represented a $1.5T dollar industry globally.98 This accounted for roughly 1.7% of global GDP that year. That is roughly the size of a major G7 country like Canada.\n\nFascinating number. Wonder how this is calculated as data on this sector is notoriously hard to come by. Answer: source is Johnson, P.D. (2018). Global Philanthropy Report: Perspectives on the global foundation sector. Harvard Kennedy School. Retrieved April 14, 2021, from: https:// cpl.hks.harvard.edu/files/cpl/files/global_philanthropy_report_final_april_2018.pdf\n\nChecking the source i suspect there is a slight confusion in the quote in that the statement is that philanthropy has approx 1.5T in *assets* (p.16 of the report)\n\n\u003e The assets of philanthropic foundations in 23 countries and Hong Kong identified in this report total close to USD 1.5 trillion.\n\nand \n\n\u003e Foundation assets are significant, with the potential for substantial social impact. The global assets of philanthropic foundations in 23 countries and Hong Kong identified in this report total close to USD 1.5 trillion. Because this study does not include all countries, or all foundations in the subject countries, and because many foundations are reluctant to make public financial information, the true figure is certainly greater.\n\nBut GDP is not a statement of assets but of output (or \"income\" roughly). Thus comparing philanthropy assets to GDP is comparing stocks to flow and highly misleading and global assets are much higher. My guess is the overstatement is between 10 and 50x i.e. philanthropic assets are 0.17% or 0.034% of global wealth.\n\np.19 they actually estimate global giving of their sample:\n\n\u003e Globally, foundation expenditures exceed USD 150 billion per annum.\n\nSo in fact spending is about 10x lower than assets (i.e. foundations actually spend on average 10% of their assets). This implies a ratio to global GDP of 0.17%. Still substantial.\n\n### Criticism of the 5% rule\n\n\u003e Let’s break this down further. In 2020, the average rate-of-return for foundation endowments was 13.1%.103 If we take a $100M foundation as an example, it would be required to give away $5M over the course of the year, but its endowment would have grown to $113M minus $5M for a year end sum of $108M\n\n\u003e It does not take an accountant or economist to understand the implications of this model. The extractive-based capital market system and the donors are the two prime beneficiaries. Only a fraction of tax-exempt philanthropic funding is actually used to address social issues while the majority is reinvested in life-destroying activities via the capitalist market with high returns-on-investment. As one interviewee quipped: “Most foundations are hedge funds with a small charitable arm attached on the side.”104 One trustee of a foundation described foundations as: “Mainly private wealth management firms for white people, with side marketing arms focused on dressing up tax avoidance strategies in so-called public and community-spiritedness.”105\n\nAgain agree with the underlying point and would even go further: don't think foundations or charities should get *any* tax exempt status. However, critique seems to focus on a side issue (the rate of distribution) and over-do it a bit IMO.\n\nSpecifically if anyone could regularly get 13% return today year after year they would be amongst best investors on earth. (cf critique of piketty in general btw). Thus 5% does not seem quite so unreasonable.\n\nMore substantively, those zinging quotes miss the point: comparing a foundation with a hedge fund is misleading. Whilst money can accumulate in a foundation it is *purpose locked* i.e. you can't use the money for your private purposes. By contrast, in a hedge fund i'm accumulating for private purposes.\n\nThere's still a big issue there even with the purpose-lock which is the concentration of power. Even with the purpose-lock there is still a great deal of discretion and power: a sole philanthropist get to ongoingly control where this wealth is directed (compared to say the democratic model for government or group funding). This is a huge amount of power to Gates or Rockefeller etc.\n\n# THE THIRD HIERARCHY - INSTITUTIONS AS FRACTAL NODES UPHOLDING THE LOGIC OF PHILANTHROPY\n\n### Philanthropy is made up of uninitiated people who feel entitled to solve the problems their culture created without understanding the impacts of their culture in the first place\n\nThis dearth of relevant experience and emotional capacity builds the edifice of the cultures at the heart of the institutions within philanthropy. As Tiokasin Ghosthorse, a Lakota elder, stated in an interview with the authors: “Philanthropy is made up of uninitiated people who feel entitled to solve the problems their culture created without understanding the impacts of their culture in the first place.”117\n\n👍👍 that last quote is a very fair critique.\n\n# THE FOURTH HIERARCHY - INDIVIDUALS AS REPLICATORS OF NEOLIBERAL LOGIC\n\n### 2 insights from 100 interviews: 1) people believe philanthrophy not working yet cannot break out; 2) universal interest in wielding power yet lack of understanding of consequences or responsibilites thereof\n\n\u003e What was clear from the hundred plus interviews we conducted was two main insights. The first is that the vast majority of people believe the current model of philanthropy is not working, yet they believe they cannot break out of the existing paradigm. We will call this the philanthropic paradox of powerlessness. The second is that there was an almost universal motivational interest in wielding power (which also includes control, status, entitlement as well as the well-meaning intent of contributing to change) yet a dearth of understanding of the consequences or responsibilities this power may have. We will call this the philanthropic paradox of power.\n\n### Philanthropy is unique and important because of role it plays (e.g. independent of the state)\n\n\u003e The juxtaposition of the paradox of powerlessness and the paradox of power leads to a striking image of a seemingly helpless elite class of philanthropic decision-makers who sense the dominant paradigm coming to an end; a recognition that their existing seat is a privileged, albeit temporary position; and a careless, almost callous disposition towards what more or what else could be done given their circumstance, access to wealth, and existing power base.\n\u003e\n\u003e Of course, on one level, this may feel like a caricature of the sector, when in fact there are countless others who do not feel powerless and are trying to grapple with their power and privilege in earnest. On another level, this description could also be true of any ordinary beneficiary or bureaucrat of the capitalist system who has a sense of the impending cascade of crises but carries on as they are.\n\u003e\n\u003e However, what is unique about philanthropy is the disproportionate power it has as a sector, largely determining the activities and parameters of civil society, actively reinforcing the status quo, all the while receiving the benefits of directing public funds, including tax breaks and social legitimacy. Also, given how interwoven philanthropy is with the fabric of society – community organisers, activists, cultural centres, educational institutions, care workers, etc. – it is critical to examine the dynamics and drivers of individuals within the sector.\n\n\n# FROM PYRAMID LOGIC TO SPIRAL LOGIC\n\n## Five Elements Mandala\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104001259.png]]\n\n## SUPERSTRUCTURE AS MYCELIAL SERVICE FOR VARIOUS BIOMES\n\n### Key aspects of the post-capitalist trans-local political economy\n\np.169 ff.\n\n\u003e Some key aspects and values for an emerging mycelial superstructure (i.e. a post capitalist, trans-local political economy) should include (but not be limited to) the following:\n\u003e \n\u003e - Creating and supporting local, bio-regional sovereignty. This does not mean there would be no government, per se, but rather, the role of the state would be to de-evolve power to the level of lived experience (i.e. local communities and bio-regions that can self-govern).\n\u003e - Promoting practices that build the currently atrophied muscles of community and citizenship in the web of life, including direct democracy, citizen’s assemblies, co- operative ownership, community decision-making and commons stewardship, as tending to the web of social, ecological cultural relations.\n\u003e - Re-calibrating notions of ‘work’ and ‘value’ to focus on the (re)cultivation of life- force and symbiosis with the natural world to create a spiritual/cognitive/creative renaissance for human and more-than-human flourishing.\n\u003e - Preparing for coming changes through the preservation of life-centric ways of being, including diverse cosmologies, cultures, geographies and languages.\n\u003e - Assisting an ecological transition for an adaptation to new environmental contexts.\n\u003e - Synthesising the best aspects of capitalist modernity (we are not anarcho-primitivists and nor do we idealise an Edenic past; we are open to the idea that there are some things worth preserving and continuing) with the best of human nature (as understood through other contexts, from Palaeolithic cooperation and creativity to surviving Indigenous cultures)198. Some have called this merger between past, present and future, the creation/remembering of Ancient Futures.199\n\u003e - Cultivating deeper humility, reverence, curiosity, and wonder as driving forces for post colonialist, post patriachal, anti-racist and post anthropocentric thinking and embodiment.\n\u003e - Honouring the fractal nature of reality by promoting practices of inner-outer mirroring so that the work we support also supports deeper onto-shifts and a deeper intimacy with the living world.\n\u003e - Embracing other ways of knowing and being, including (and especially) animistic and fugitive worldviews that allow for a deepening of new-ancient-emerging onto-ethico- epistemologies.\n\n### Water\n\n\u003e Work in this area can include funding and aligning with land and water protectors, food/land/water/medicine/cultural sovereignty projects, indigenous sciences, resistance movements, the Rights of Nature200, legal jurisprudence, elders/wisdom circles and supporting the Life Plans201 and the myriad efforts led by Indigenous communities that preserve and uplift their self-determination.\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104094645.png]]\n\n### Fire\n\n\u003e On the right-hand side of the Restoration and Solidarity continuum we have the element of Fire, with a focus on being in solidarity with social movements. Some of the most critical economic alternatives can be found amongst these groups, as they condense the lived experience of oppression whilst living and embodying other ways of knowing and being that in many cases already exemplify a state of post capitalism.\n\u003e \n\u003e In terms of a few initial examples within the Fire element, this is where the philanthropic biome can nurture the social ecologies focused on issues such as:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Economic justice – This includes de-growth \u0026 post-growth economics, universal basic income, a global wealth tax, abandoning GDP, the abolition of tax havens, a living wage, a shorter work week and universal basic assets including healthcare, alternative modes of education, and other issues.\n\u003e - Commons justice – Infrastructure and policy that supports things such as co- operative ownership structures, the right to community spaces etc.\n\u003e - Freedom of expression – This includes preventing extra-judicial killings, the right to protest, and other traditional human rights issues.\n\u003e - Democracy – Including alternatives such as direct democracy and citizen’s assemblies. Racial justice – Dismantling systemic racism and engaging in reparations and reconciliation work.\n\u003e - Food/land/water/medicine/cultural sovereignty – Bio-regional self-sufficiency and support for movements, especially those facing agri-business interests, the World Bank and other encroachers of the commons.\n\u003e - Labour issues – Including support for trade-unions and worker-owned cooperatives. LGBTQI rights – This includes the gender justice movements more broadly.\n\u003e - Education issues – This includes both alternative education and “alternatives to education.”.202\n\u003e - Migration rights – This will become increasingly important as the climate catastrophe worsens and the traditional nation-state unravels. This work may include the abolition of borders and even ultimately the nation-state altogether.\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104094706.png]]\n\n### Earth\n\n\u003e The Earth element includes, but is not limited to, supporting commons-based land stewardship (including creating local land trusts); alternative communities (and other experiments “outside the grid”); mutual aid networks; alternative currencies; open- source knowledge systems for locally tailoring decentralised models of production and consumption; ecological restoration and protection; and bio-regional resiliency and sovereignty (including work involving land, water, food, energy, medicine, health, education, cultural regeneration and sovereignty).\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104094812.png]]\n\n### Air\n\n\u003e On the other side of the Transformation and Creation continuum is the element of Air: supporting new-ancient-emerging cultural contexts. In addition to creating the post capitalist infrastructure, we must also shift our cultural conditions, the memetic landscape of beliefs, and our dominant ontologies and cosmologies in order for emerging alternatives to take root and flourish. Given the contextual and place-based nature of this work, it is important to note that culture change work is extremely hard to propagate. It may be less the engine of the onto-shift and more of a context cleanser to make the environment less toxic and to help prepare the conditions for the change. We must open up spaces to create, imagine, and dream together.\n\u003e\n\u003e This is the realm of artists, poets, culture hackers, shamans, educators and others. Here we include supporting cultural narrative work; artistic and creative interventions; emerging media approaches; sacred activism (work that goes beyond the binaries of traditional activism to include prayer and other trans-rational approaches); gatherings and other ways of accompanying and deepening relations (which are often not seen as a viable programmatic areas in and of themselves but are critical to nurturing a connective/relational fabric); and even the work that disrupts the philanthropic sector itself.\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104102009.png]]\n\n### Ether\n\n\u003e  The final element is Ether: (Re)cultivating Life-Force. As we have discussed, this is especially critical because neoliberalism is an onslaught against our reproductive and regenerative abilities to heal and participate in the continuum of life and death. The perpetual trauma-inducing context of struggling to survive the spiritual desert must be countered by an equivalent or greater resurgence of life-force energy. The thought-form and experience of individuation and separation thwarts us from experiencing and connecting to the swelling currents of life that move through us and all around us in each moment.\n\u003e\n\u003e In some ways, this is the most difficult element for which to give examples, as there are infinite paths into the work of healing and connecting to Life, all of which are highly subjective and must be contextually determined. We recognise that some of the modalities may be perceived as focused on individual healing; regardless, we are including a broad umbrella for Ether as we don’t know what will crack us open, or what could transform our being.\n\u003e\n\u003e Some examples include: reconciliation and restoration circles; family constellations, trauma, and somatic-based therapies; ancestral healing work; physical embodiment practices, meditation and contemplation; rites of passage work; place-based spiritual practices (such as the Lakota Inipi or Sweatlodge); cultivation of personal and communal creativity; supporting the resurgence of mystery schools; nature-based education; grief circles and other communal rituals; and working with psychedelic medicines (especially those rooted in traditional cultures with the skillful means for true healing, such as Amazonian shamanic traditions).\n\u003e\n\u003e Again, with all of these practices, it’s critical that we do not replicate the coloniser’s approach of consumption and acquisition, which keeps us locked in egoic, self- centred states of asking only “what I can gain” from this experience. We not only recommend the support and accessibility of these modalities for practitioners, but especially for wealth holders and wealth granters. Just as all oppression is connected, all healing is interconnected. The deepening of inner practices by all who are affected by and entangled in the murky, complex world of social change (especially social change that requires money) must continually strive to heal, integrate and reconnect themselves and their awareness to the present moment and the continuum of life.\n\n![[../../assets/notes/Pasted image 20221104102140.png]]\n\n### Other concrete recommendations\n\n#### Abolish milestone reports and bureaucratic processes\n\n\u003e We also recommend the abolition of milestone reports and bureaucratic processes, including reimagining and redesigning the entire due-diligence process. We suggest moving towards relationally-based giving practices focused on generosity, reciprocity and trust. This could include other democratic means of giving, such as giving circles and/or flow funding, where embedded activists are given set amounts of funds to distribute within their respective communities.\n\u003e \n### Diversify the board\n\n\u003e Another obvious practice is to diversify the board and leadership to include more activists and practitioners who will challenge power, ontological biases, and institutional comfort.\n\n### Divest from equity markets and let go of idea of private ownership\n\n\u003e Then comes the endowment work. We believe it is a necessary precondition that foundations begin divesting from equity markets and engage with the critical work of historical reparations. This will require a fundamental shift in the notion of organisational preservation, growth, legacy and other historical entitlements.\n\u003e\n\u003e All of these practices require onto-shifts at their core: they are about letting go of the very idea of private ownership and decision-making, entitlements and privileges. These practices are not merely being made because they are the right thing to do, but because this wealth is the world’s collective endowment; stewardship is a shared responsibility; and capital should be liberated in service to the living world.\n\nYes ... and hmmmm. e.g.\n\n\u003e  ... letting go of the very idea of private ownership and decision-making, entitlements and privileges\n\nDecision-making is hard. Group and collective decision-making is harder. Would need to think really thoroughly about how this would work. We (as humanity) have had plenty of poor experiences in moving to more collective approaches which either become dysfunctionally ineffective (cf [[notebook/books/landry-1985-what-way-run]]) or dysfunctionally oppressive with power and control manifesting again in unhealthy shadow ways (e.g. many forms of state communism).","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,T=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(a,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),g=(a,e)=\u003e{for(var t in e)o(a,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},l=(a,e,t,r)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let n of u(e))!T.call(a,n)\u0026\u0026n!==t\u0026\u0026o(a,n,{get:()=\u003ee[n],enumerable:!(r=m(e,n))||r.enumerable});return a};var Q=(a,e,t)=\u003e(t=a!=null?c(p(a)):{},l(e||!a||!a.__esModule?o(t,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):t,a)),w=a=\u003el(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var h=f((H,s)=\u003e{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var y={};g(y,{default:()=\u003eb});var i=Q(h());function d(a){let e=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",p:\"p\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",ol:\"ol\",em:\"em\",h3:\"h3\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",span:\"span\",\"mjx-container\":\"mjx-container\",defs:\"defs\",g:\"g\",use:\"use\",img:\"img\",h4:\"h4\",style:\"style\"},a.components),t=e[\"mjx-container\"];return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.h1,{id:\"post-capitalist-philanthropy-by-alnoor-ladha-and-lynn-murphy-2022\",children:\"Post Capitalist Philanthropy by Alnoor Ladha and Lynn Murphy (2022)\"}),`\n`,(0,i.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"summary\",children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#summary\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Summary\"]}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Steel-manned with my own additions.
