Keynes’s Mistake\\\n\u003e 2. The Faustian Bargain\\\n\u003e 3. The Uses of Wealth\\\n\u003e 4. The Mirage of Happiness\\\n\u003e 5. Limits to Growth: Natural or Moral?\\\n\u003e 6.

Exits from the Rat Race\n\n### The question\n\nThe title question “How Much is Enough?” is, in fact, a lead in to a\nmore fundamental question: “How Much for What?” to which the answer is\nto “Live the Good Life”. The book’s main purpose therefore to answer the\nmore basic question “What is the Good Life?” — rather than its title.\n\n\u003e “The purpose of this book is to persuade the reader that such a\n\u003e thing—the good life—does exist and can be known, and that we ought to\n\u003e strive to live it. How much money we need to live it comes at the end\n\u003e of the argument, not at the beginning.” \\[Preface\\]\n\n### The answer\n\nThe “Good Life consists in realising the following “basic goods” (or\nultimate goods or end-values) (see [*spreadsheet with\ncomparison*](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1ovCln-ZZyNSbH-l-L65REcbb9O9WjBb6D7hp4-31xdw)),\nas set out in *Chapter 6: Elements of the Good Life*:\n\n-   *Health*. By health we mean the full functioning of the body, the\n    \u003e perfection of our animal nature. Health includes all things needed\n    \u003e to sustain life, or a reasonable span of life, but is by no means\n    \u003e limited to them.\n\n-   *Security*. By security we mean an individual’s justified\n    \u003e expectation that his life will continue more or less in its\n    \u003e accustomed course, undisturbed by war, crime, revolution or major\n    \u003e social and economic upheavals.\n\n-   *Respect*. To respect someone is to indicate, by some formality or\n    \u003e otherwise, that one regards his views and interests as worthy of\n    \u003e consideration, as things not to be ignored or trampled on.\n\n-   *Personality*. By personality we mean first of all the ability to\n    \u003e frame and execute a plan of life reflective of one’s tastes,\n    \u003e temperament and conception of the good.\n\n-   *Harmony with Nature*. TODO - not that clearly defined by them ...\n\n-   *Friendship*. This is a necessarily inadequate translation of the\n    \u003e ancient Greek philia, a term encompassing all robust,\n    \u003e affectionate relationships. A father, spouse, teacher and workmate\n    \u003e might all be “friends” in our sense of the term.\n\n-   *Leisure*. Leisure is that which we do for its own sake, not as a\n    \u003e means to something else. This contrasts with contemporary use\n    \u003e where leisure is synonymous with relaxation and rest. But leisure\n    \u003e is not just time off work but a special form of activity in its\n    \u003e own right.\n\n### Lead-in and Background\n\nChapters one to five:\n\n-   establish that there is a problem (and why was Keynes wrong that\n    \u003e everything would be great by now)\n\n-   some of the causes of that problem (in the nature of capitalism).\n    \u003e Their critique of modern capitalism.\n\n-   Critique alternative critiques of capitalism and their solutions:\n    \u003e “Before outlining our vision of the good life, we must look at a\n    \u003e couple of other influential attempts to halt the\n    \u003e growth juggernaut. The first appeals to the concept of happiness,\n    \u003e the second to that of sustainability. We are in sympathy with the\n    \u003e goals of both movements, but believe they mislocate the real basis\n    \u003e of our objection to endless growth, which is ethical, not\n    \u003e utilitarian.”\n\n    -   “Happiness” — still lacks sensible ends (“happiness is not a\n        \u003e well-defined or good end in itself), still obsseses over more\n        \u003e (“happier, fitter”)\n\n    -   (Deep) Ecology / Sustainability: either has no clear set of\n        \u003e alternative ends — “sustainability” — or, the ends are\n        \u003e unconvincing — “deep ecology”. Simple sustainability is a\n        \u003e utilitarian argument: we are using too much now to\n        \u003e be sustainable. Deep ecology is a fairly muddy set of ideas\n        \u003e around the inherent value of animals and nature. This may be\n        \u003e important but it is insufficient in itself as a powerful\n        \u003e vision of the good life.\n\n-   Distinguish “good life” from hedonism - and the happiness obsession.\n    \u003e \\[ed: This is a sensible distinction in my opinion\\]\n\n### Critique of Capitalism\n\n*Comment: they argue (rightly) that the very fact of setting out these\nvalues and implicitly arguing for their universal validity is important\n— and radical (irrespective of whether their precise set of values is\nperfectly correct). Modern capitalism has increasingly got trapped in a\nfalse relativistic mindset other based by the following erroneous\nassumptions:*\n\n-   *Relativism - “de gustibus non est disputandam”, “chacun a son\n    \u003e gout”, “each to their own taste”*\n\n-   *Hedonism - a focus on pleasure or happiness (a confusion of hedonia\n    \u003e with eudaimonia)*\n\n-   *Insatiability (“more is always better”)*\n\n-   *\\[together\\] =\u0026gt; Individualistic hedonistic libertarian\n    \u003e relativisim*\n\nAn aside on growth: “Where does all this leave *growth*? Obviously no\nsane policy has growth itself as a final end.”\n\n-   \"First, growth might sensibly be pursued as a *means* to one or more\n    \u003e of the basic goods.\"\n\n-   \"Second, **growth might interest us as an *index* of something else\n    \u003e we value**. … growth “should not be considered the *objective* of\n    \u003e economic policy, but rather the highly likely outcome … of two\n    \u003e things desirable in themselves—economic freedom to make choices,\n    \u003e and a spirit of continual enquiry and desire for change.”\n\n## Evaluation\n\nA tight, well-written, and well-argued book on an important topic.\n\n-   TODO: Would be interesting to track down responses in media — would\n    \u003e give a flavour of attitudes out there.\n\n-   TODO: would be interesting to start doing surveys amongst people on\n    \u003e end-values just like e.g. Schwarz is doing on behaviour-values.\n\n### What was missing?** **What could be improved?\n\n-   A stronger sense of why we have ended up here —- and the strategy\n    \u003e for getting to this place. These ideas are not that novel … “if\n    \u003e you’re so right, why aren’t more people in agreement”. This would\n    \u003e include:\n\n    -   Psychological traps (see below)\n\n    -   Collective action traps. People are embedded in a network of\n        \u003e social relations and financial relations. If everyone were to\n        \u003e opt out it would work but if I just do so i may face problems\n        \u003e (including access to goods like housing — if everyone stays in\n        \u003e the rat race I may find myself priced out)\n\n-   Little or no awareness of Buddhist thought or mindfulness as\n    \u003e a practice. Buddhism mentioned just 3 times in main text and then\n    \u003e only in passing e.g.\n\n    -   “Buddhism is usually counted as the third traditional teaching\n        \u003e of China, but in terms of its influence on the culture at\n        \u003e large, it can be grouped together with Taoism.” \\[not even\n        \u003e accurate\\]\n\n    -   \\[Buddhism largely subsumed under Hinduism\\]“the Hindu\n        \u003e scriptures urge us to extinguish it altogether. “He who is\n        \u003e without desire, who is freed from desire …—he goes to\n        \u003e Brahma.”^*17*^ This ideal, better known to us under its\n        \u003e Buddhist name of nirvana, bears some resemblance to the Stoic\n        \u003e concept of apatheia or tranquillity, but is otherwise without\n        \u003e parallel in the West.”\n\n-   A lack of consideration for the psychological factors. Getting in\n    \u003e caught in the treadmill of capitalistic growth may be due largely\n    \u003e to strong psychological features (acquisitiveness, competition,\n    \u003e individualistic and dualistic ways of thinking). We have to ask\n    \u003e why we don’t pursue the ideals they set out — they aren’t, after\n    \u003e all, entirely novel. I would argue that a big part of the answer\n    \u003e to that is our own erroneous cognitive and behavioural patterns —\n    \u003e and that mindful (Buddhist) ontology and practice are central to\n    \u003e addressing those errors.\n\n## Excerpts\n\n### Preface\n\n\u003e In a previous book, Robert Skidelsky did venture to name a sum that\n\u003e the economist John Maynard Keynes would have considered “enough” to\n\u003e satisfy *average* needs: £40,000 or \\$66,000 or €46,000 a year (in\n\u003e today’s money). See Robert Skidelsky, *Keynes: The Return of the\n\u003e Master*, 2nd edn. (London: Penguin, 2010), p. 142, which also reveals\n\u003e the basis of the calculation. But Keynes was assuming a more settled\n\u003e idea of what the good life was than is now true, and less pressure to\n\u003e lead a bad life than now exists.\n\nTODO: check the reference and the details of the calculation of this\nnumber in the referenced book\n\n### Critique of insatiability and capitalism\n\nIntroduction - p.1\n\n\u003e This book is an argument against insatiability, against that\n\u003e psychological disposition that prevents us, as individuals and as\n\u003e societies, from saying “enough is enough.” It is directed at economic\n\u003e insatiability, the desire for more and more money. It is chiefly\n\u003e directed at the rich parts of the world, which may be reasonably\n\u003e thought to have enough wealth for a decent collective life. For the\n\u003e poor parts of the world, where the mass of the people still live in\n\u003e great poverty, insatiability is a problem for the future. But in rich\n\u003e and poor societies alike, insatiability can be seen wherever the\n\u003e opulence of the very rich runs wildly ahead of the means of existence\n\u003e of the many.\n\u003e\n\u003e Marxists contend that economic insatiability is a creation of\n\u003e capitalism, which will disappear with its abolition. Christians argue\n\u003e that it is the product of original sin. Our own view is that it is\n\u003e rooted in human nature—in the disposition to compare our fortune with\n\u003e that of our fellows and find it wanting—but has been greatly\n\u003e intensified by capitalism, which has made it the psychological basis\n\u003e of an entire civilization. What was once an aberration of the rich is\n\u003e now a commonplace of everyday life.\n\u003e\n\u003e Capitalism is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it has made possible\n\u003e vast improvements in material conditions. On the other, it has exalted\n\u003e some of the most reviled human characteristics, such as greed, envy\n\u003e and avarice. Our call is to chain up the monster again by recalling\n\u003e what the greatest thinkers of all times and all civilizations have\n\u003e meant by the “good life” and suggesting changes in current policy to\n\u003e help us achieve it.\n\u003e\n\u003e In doing this, we will be challenging the current obsession with the\n\u003e growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the chief goal of economic\n\u003e policy. We are not against economic growth as such, but we may\n\u003e reasonably ask not just growth *for* what, but growth *of* what. We\n\u003e want leisure to grow and pollution to decline. Both are part of any\n\u003e sane idea of human welfare. But both are excluded from GDP, which\n\u003e measures only that portion of domestic production that is traded in\n\u003e markets. There is no subtraction for pollution, and no addition for\n\u003e leisure. The extent to which further GDP growth will improve welfare\n\u003e is therefore moot. It surely does so for very poor countries, but it\n\u003e may be the case that rich societies already have *too much* GDP.\n\n…\n\n\u003e First, he asked something hardly discussed today: what is wealth for?\n\u003e How much money do we need to lead a good life? This might seem an\n\u003e impossible question. But it is not a trivial one. Making money cannot\n\u003e be an end in itself—at least for anyone not suffering from acute\n\u003e mental disorder. To say that my purpose in life is to make more and\n\u003e more money is like saying that my aim in eating is to get fatter and\n\u003e fatter. And what is true of individuals is also true of societies.\n\nAside: What is wrong with capitalism \\[ed: our comments more than\nauthors\\]\n\n-   It does not have base values\n\n-   It ends up substituting its own “non-well” ways of behaving for\n    \u003e these values — i.e. greed, envy, accumulativeness etc\n\n-   Note: humans like to compare themselves — so they tend to like\n    \u003e metrics that allow for comparison. Capitalism hooks into that\n    \u003e big time.\n\nAside: Notes about environmental point:\n\n-   Environmental “capital” is undermeasured — and under-priced\n\n-   Evidence that we have a problem - and that we mismeasure “growth” if\n    \u003e we use GDP\n\n    -   Economic Growth, Carrying Capacity, and the Environment.

They are:\n\n-   Universal …\n\n-   Final — not just a means to some other good.\n\n-   Sui-generis / largest category version of themselves. E.g. health vs\n    \u003e freedom from cancer. Former is the ultimate category for\n    \u003e the latter.\n\n-   Indispensable: loss of them would be bad for *anyone*\n\nExcerpt:\n\n\u003e An air of arbitrariness hangs over lists of basic goods, to dispel\n\u003e which we must make clear our criteria of inclusion. There are four:\n\u003e\n\u003e 1\\. Basic goods are *universal*, meaning that they belong to the good\n\u003e life as such, not just some particular, local conception of it. To see\n\u003e the universal through the particular requires strong philosophical\n\u003e intuitions, guided by the testimony of different ages and cultures. This\n\u003e latter proviso is frequently forgotten. Too often, the “intuitions” of\n\u003e modern philosophers simply repeat the platitudes of early\n\u003e twenty-first-century liberalism. Nussbaum’s catalogue of central human\n\u003e capabilities includes, for example, “protection against discrimination\n\u003e on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, caste,\n\u003e ethnicity, or national origin”—an impeccably progressive list, but\n\u003e hardly a universal one.^10^ A more philosophical caste of mind might\n\u003e question the equation of universal with modern liberal values. After\n\u003e all, from the standpoint of eternity, our own civilization is just as\n\u003e parochial as any other.\n\u003e\n\u003e 2\\. Basic goods are *final*, meaning that that they are good in\n\u003e themselves, and not just as a means to some other good. (This\n\u003e distinguishes our basic goods from Rawls’s primary goods and from\n\u003e Nussbaum and Sen’s capabilities.) The standard philosopher’s way of\n\u003e uncovering final goods is to ask “what for?” over and over, like certain\n\u003e annoying small children. When no further answer is forthcoming, we know\n\u003e we have hit upon a final good. “What is that bicycle for?” “To get me to\n\u003e work.” “And what is work for?” “To make me money.” “And what is money\n\u003e for?” “To buy me food.” “And what is food for?” “To keep me alive.” “And\n\u003e what is life for?” Blank stare. Life is not “for” anything. In our\n\u003e terms, it is part of the basic good of health.\n\u003e\n\u003e All basic goods are final, but not all final goods are basic. An\n\u003e explanatory chain might conceivably come to an end with “in order to\n\u003e complete my collection of Soviet stamps.” Completing a stamp\n\u003e collection is a final good—it is not usually for the sake of anything\n\u003e else—but it is not basic, since it fails the test of both universality\n\u003e and indispensability, to be discussed in more detail below.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Many philosophers would want to add an additional last term to any\n\u003e given sequence of explanations, namely “in order to make me happy.” We\n\u003e think this is a mistake. Outside psychiatric clinics and philosophy\n\u003e seminars, people do not generally explain their actions by saying\n\u003e “this will make me happy.”** As we have already argued in Chapter 4,\n\u003e this is a strong reason not to treat happiness as the ultimate good.\n\u003e\n\u003e The requirement of finality rules out many goods that appear at first\n\u003e glance to be basic. Food, for instance, features in many traditional\n\u003e lists of basic goods, but as the above chain of questions shows, it is\n\u003e in fact instrumental to the basic good of life or health. Indulged in\n\u003e beyond this point, it ceases to be useful, and may even be harmful.\n\u003e (This is not to say that all spices and relishes superfluous to health\n\u003e are not good, just that they are not *basic* goods. We do not wish to\n\u003e reduce everyone to a diet of salad and tofu.) More relevantly to our\n\u003e theme, money cannot be a basic good, since it is essentially an\n\u003e instrument for obtaining other things. Other goods are more ambiguous.\n\u003e Health, security and leisure are on some accounts final, on others\n\u003e instrumental. We return to this issue below.\n\u003e\n\u003e 3\\. Basic goods are *sui generis*, meaning that they are not part of some\n\u003e other good. The good of “freedom from cancer” is certainly universal and\n\u003e final, but not basic, because it can be subsumed under the larger good\n\u003e of health. Whether a good is *sui generis* or not is often hard to\n\u003e decide. For instance, family relationships, which we have included under\n\u003e the good of “friendship,” might be thought to merit a separate heading\n\u003e of their own. However, since what makes family and non-family\n\u003e relationships good is very much the same set of things—love, trust,\n\u003e stability—we decided that two categories would be superfluous.\n\u003e\n\u003e 4\\. Basic goods are *indispensable*, meaning that anyone who lacks them\n\u003e may be deemed to have suffered a serious loss or harm. The qualification\n\u003e “anyone” is important. That missing, set-completing stamp might cause\n\u003e the stamp fanatic much genuine anguish, but this does not make a basic\n\u003e good. Nor need the loss or harm in question be perceived as such by its\n\u003e victim. Harms are frequently so taken for granted that they no longer\n\u003e register, but they are still harms.\n\n### Seven Basic Goods\n\nThere are seven basic goods:\n\n-   [*Health*](#kix.36nobtggvn5a)\n\n-   [*Security*](#security)\n\n-   Harmony with Nature\n\n-   Friendship\n\n-   Respect\n\n-   Personality\n\n-   Leisure\n\nComparison [*in a\ntable*](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1ovCln-ZZyNSbH-l-L65REcbb9O9WjBb6D7hp4-31xdw).\n\n#### Health\n\n\u003e *Health*. By health we mean the full functioning of the body, the\n\u003e perfection of our animal nature. Health includes all things needed to\n\u003e sustain life, or a reasonable span of life, but is by no means limited\n\u003e to them. It implies vitality, energy, alertness and that ruddy beauty\n\u003e favored by Tolstoy and other moralists over more decadent ideals.\n\u003e Health is generally associated with absence of bodily pain, but its\n\u003e value is not purely utilitarian, for a comfortably ill person (on a\n\u003e morphine drip, say) is still worse off than a healthy one. Above all,\n\u003e health means a happy obliviousness of one’s own body, as of a tool\n\u003e perfectly fitted to its tasks. In the words of French physician René\n\u003e Leriche, it is “life lived in the silence of the organs.”^12^ Health\n\u003e looks outwards. Illness throws one back upon oneself.\n\u003e\n\u003e Many philosophers have ranked health lower than the other goods, on\n\u003e the grounds that it belongs to our animal as opposed to our\n\u003e distinctively human nature. “It is for the sake of the soul,” wrote\n\u003e Aristotle, setting the tone, “that … goods of the body are desirable\n\u003e at all, and all wise men ought to choose them for the sake of the\n\u003e soul, and not the soul for the sake of them.”^13^ If this is true,\n\u003e then health is not final in our sense, and so has no place on a list\n\u003e of basic human goods. But why deny health the status of a final end\n\u003e simply because animals can enjoy it too? Is that not just an\n\u003e intellectual’s prejudice? Our admiration of a young man’s vitality\n\u003e need not involve the further thought that it will help him walk to\n\u003e work, serve his country or whatever. We can admire it for its own\n\u003e sake, just as we do that of a playing dolphin or leopard cub.\n\u003e\n\u003e Today, health is the one good on which liberal states feel entitled to\n\u003e take a positive stance, for, unlike the goods of the soul, it carries\n\u003e the authority of science. But is there really a distinction here?\n\u003e Science can tell us whether drug *x* treats condition *y*, but not\n\u003e that condition *y* itself constitutes “ill-health.” This latter\n\u003e presupposes a pre-scientific, common-sense understanding of what it is\n\u003e for human beings to flourish. We all know a healthy baby when we see\n\u003e one, just as we all recognize blindness and lameness as disabilities.\n\u003e Other cases are more controversial. How fat does one have to be to\n\u003e count as overweight? How bodily capable to count as fit? Our answer to\n\u003e these questions will depend on what we think of the martial virtues,\n\u003e of sport, sex and much else besides. In short, judgments of health are\n\u003e objective in the same sense and to the same degree as ethical\n\u003e judgments: they too rest on an idea of human flourishing.\n\u003e\n\u003e Given this relationship, it is not surprising to find that the eclipse\n\u003e of teleological thinking in our culture has proceeded hand in hand\n\u003e with an unravelling of the concept of health. The process is similar\n\u003e to that we have already traced in connection with money. An earlier\n\u003e notion of health as being in “tip-top condition,” with everything\n\u003e “working as it should,” has given way to a new ideal of perpetual\n\u003e improvement. One symptom of this slippage is our obsession with\n\u003e longevity. Older medical traditions aimed to help individuals realize\n\u003e their natural lifespan; dying “of old age” was not deemed a calamity.\n\u003e But if there is no such thing as a natural lifespan, only a shifting,\n\u003e culturally relative norm, then death at *any* age can be seen as a\n\u003e regrettable and remediable failing. Modern science has rekindled the\n\u003e old alchemical promise of eternal youth; meanwhile, people who a few\n\u003e decades earlier would have died swiftly and relatively painlessly are\n\u003e kept alive in a state of chronic, debilitating sickness.^\\*^\n\u003e\n\u003e Another symptom of this disorientation is the disappearance of any\n\u003e sharp distinction between *curing* the sick and *enhancing* the\n\u003e already healthy. Once the dividing-line was clear-cut: vital\n\u003e operations fell on one side, cosmetic improvements on the other. But\n\u003e if there is no such thing as perfect health, then *any* undesirable\n\u003e condition can be defined as illness and made an object of medical\n\u003e treatment. (And, as we saw in Chapter 1, there is no limit to the\n\u003e number of things that people can find undesirable.) This whole process\n\u003e is hastened along by the drugs companies, who have a strong interest\n\u003e in identifying the illnesses that their products will cure. The role\n\u003e of Pfizer, manufacturer of Viagra, in transforming what was once part\n\u003e and parcel of the human comedy into the fearsome new ailment of\n\u003e “erectile dysfunction” is a case in point.\n\u003e\n\u003e Ultimately, this assimilation of medicine to the economic rat race\n\u003e destroys the very idea of good health. If every state of the body can\n\u003e be seen as defective relative to some other, preferred state, then we\n\u003e are all in a sense perpetually ill. The world becomes, as Goethe said\n\u003e it would, a vast hospital, in which everyone is nurse to everyone\n\u003e else. What is more, where the demand for health is insatiable, medical\n\u003e costs expand in tandem with or faster than income, keeping us tethered\n\u003e to the work/growth treadmill. It is thus crucial to our purpose that\n\u003e health *not* be defined in this demand-relative sense, but retain the\n\u003e older meaning of the body’s natural perfection. For it is only in this\n\u003e sense that it can function as part of a criterion of enoughness.\n\n#### Security\n\n\u003e *Security*. By security we mean an individual’s justified expectation\n\u003e that his life will continue more or less in its accustomed course,\n\u003e undisturbed by war, crime, revolution or major social and economic\n\u003e upheavals. Security is a necessary condition for the realization of\n\u003e other basic goods on our list, in particular personality, friendship\n\u003e and leisure. But it is also a good in itself. Like any creature, a\n\u003e human being has an environment, a set of taken-for-granted objects\n\u003e against which his life runs its course. If this environment is changed\n\u003e abruptly or frequently, he will feel perplexed and threatened, like a\n\u003e cat in a new house or a caged animal released into the wild. Of\n\u003e course, as intelligent beings, we have in us that which transcends any\n\u003e environment—which sees “the stars above the roof,” as the philosopher\n\u003e Josef Pieper puts it.^14^ Nonetheless, roofs and all that they imply\n\u003e are still necessary, not least as providing a stable location from\n\u003e which to gaze upon the stars. Across the world, the word “peace” has a\n\u003e soothing ring, while “turmoil,” “chaos” and their equivalents bode\n\u003e ill.\n\u003e\n\u003e To be sure, there are types—tyrants, speculators, romantic poets—who\n\u003e thrive on chaos. Chairman Mao, a tyrant and a romantic poet, loved\n\u003e chaos so much that he renamed it “permanent revolution.” In the West,\n\u003e security has so long been vilified by bohemian artists and\n\u003e intellectuals that admitting to a fondness for it now is almost like\n\u003e admitting to a fondness for garden gnomes. Yet the truth is that\n\u003e security is cherished by all creative spirits—including poets, when\n\u003e they are honest with themselves—as a condition of their own\n\u003e productivity. W. B. Yeats, writing in 1919, as Ireland descended into\n\u003e war, prayed that his young daughter would grow up to enjoy security:\n\u003e\n\u003e And may her bridegroom bring her to a house\n\u003e\n\u003e Where all’s accustomed, ceremonious;\n\u003e\n\u003e For arrogance and hatred are the wares\n\u003e\n\u003e Peddled in the thoroughfares.\n\u003e\n\u003e How but in custom and in ceremony\n\u003e\n\u003e Are innocence and beauty born?\n\u003e\n\u003e Ceremony’s a name for the rich horn,\n\u003e\n\u003e And custom for the spreading laurel tree.\n\u003e\n\u003e Yeats was not immune to the romanticism of disorder. He had written\n\u003e rapturously about the “terrible beauty” of the Easter 1916 uprising.\n\u003e Yet faced with real chaos, his choice was clear. He knew that extreme\n\u003e civil disorder is destructive of the arts of civilization.\n\u003e\n\u003e What are the effects of capitalism on security? Nineteenth-century\n\u003e liberals argued that *le doux commerce* would have a pacifying\n\u003e influence on international relations, since nations that traded with\n\u003e each other would have no good economic reasons to go to war. This\n\u003e argument has something to it, though of course trading nations can\n\u003e still go to war for bad economic or non-economic reasons, as they did\n\u003e in 1914. Internally, the effect of free markets on security is less\n\u003e salutary. “All that is solid melts into air,” wrote Marx famously,\n\u003e referring to the endless revolution of technologies, skills and ways\n\u003e of life under capitalism. This perpetual ripping up of the social\n\u003e fabric is wearisome for both workers and consumers. It is particularly\n\u003e taxing for those over the age of 40 or 50, who may have lost their\n\u003e taste for novelty. Free-market fundamentalists respond to such\n\u003e discontents with thinly veiled contempt. Those who cannot find work\n\u003e locally are urged to relocate, those whose talents have become\n\u003e redundant to “retool.” This is to get things precisely backwards. It\n\u003e is not human beings who need adapting to the market; it is the market\n\u003e that needs adapting to human beings. That was the guiding principle of\n\u003e the early twentieth-century social liberals, whose enlightened efforts\n\u003e to minimize the insecurities of capitalism have now largely been\n\u003e jettisoned, as we shall see in the next chapter.\n\n#### Respect\n\n\u003e *Respect*. To respect someone is to indicate, by some formality or\n\u003e otherwise, that one regards his views and interests as worthy of\n\u003e consideration, as things not to be ignored or trampled on. Respect\n\u003e does not imply agreement or liking: one can respect an enemy. It does\n\u003e not imply any special admiration. But it does imply a certain\n\u003e recognition or “taking account” of the other’s point of view, an\n\u003e attitude fundamentally different from that shown towards animals. One\n\u003e can have great affection for a pet dog, but not respect or\n\u003e disrespect.^\\*^\n\u003e\n\u003e Respect is a necessary condition of other basic goods, friendship in\n\u003e particular. But it is also a good in itself. Everywhere, slavery—that\n\u003e is, the complete withdrawal of respect—is regarded as a calamity\n\u003e second only to or worse than death. Indeed, as has often been said,\n\u003e slavery is a kind of social death, since the slave, though still human\n\u003e in the biological sense, has lost the *status* of a human being. “That\n\u003e look was not one between two men,” writes Primo Levi, a survivor of\n\u003e Auschwitz, recalling his cross-examination by a Nazi scientist.^15^\n\u003e Those exposed regularly to such looks soon come to assimilate their\n\u003e perspective. Self-respect cannot long survive the withdrawal of\n\u003e respect.\n\u003e\n\u003e Respect need not be equal or reciprocal. I can respect someone who\n\u003e respects me less or not at all. Nonetheless, reciprocal respect is\n\u003e uniquely satisfying to both parties, for our deepest wish is for the\n\u003e respect of those whom we ourselves respect. (The adoration of a\n\u003e sycophant or a mob leads more often to self-contempt than to\n\u003e self-respect.) In all ages, we find groups of “peers” or “equals”\n\u003e respecting each other while looking down on everyone else. The\n\u003e citizenry of ancient Athens was one such group, as was the medieval\n\u003e nobility. Modern democracy extends the circle of peers to all adults\n\u003e in a given territory. Whether or not its triumph is guaranteed by\n\u003e History, as Francis Fukuyama has claimed, it now has the support of\n\u003e almost all the world, at least on paper. No modern vision of the good\n\u003e life can be such as to thwart it. This rules out, as we noted in\n\u003e Chapter 3, values such as mastery and “greatness of soul,” which\n\u003e cannot in principle be universalized.\n\u003e\n\u003e Respect has many sources, varying from culture to culture. Strength,\n\u003e money, land, nobility, education and office have all figured\n\u003e prominently at one time or another. In modern bourgeois societies, the\n\u003e two basic sources of respect are civil rights and personal\n\u003e achievement. Civil rights confer what one might call “formal” respect;\n\u003e they guarantee their possessor protection against the worst forms of\n\u003e arbitrary power. But because they are bestowed on all citizens\n\u003e regardless of their merits, they are powerless to create real respect.\n\u003e For this, an individual must make something of his life; at the very\n\u003e least, he must earn an “honest crust.” Rank and title no longer\n\u003e automatically confer respect. The modern-day duke must prove his worth\n\u003e by sitting on charitable boards and so forth; otherwise he appears\n\u003e little better than a parasite.\n\u003e\n\u003e Equality of formal respect can coexist with inequality of real\n\u003e respect, but only up to a point. If the gulf grows too gross, formal\n\u003e equality will come under strain. Suppose (what is not too implausible)\n\u003e that persistent unemployment were to lead to the division of society\n\u003e into two hereditary castes, a working majority and a jobless minority.\n\u003e It would then be all too easy to enshrine this de facto distinction in\n\u003e law, with differential civil and voting rights. Democracy as we know\n\u003e it would cease to exist. It is also important for mutual respect that\n\u003e inequality not exceed certain bounds.^16^ An elite that lives, plays\n\u003e and learns entirely separately from the general population will feel\n\u003e no bond of common citizenship with it. A more equal—not a completely\n\u003e equal—distribution of wealth and income is a requirement of democratic\n\u003e solidarity.\n\u003e\n\u003e It is a feature of our approach, in contrast to most recent liberal\n\u003e discussions, that the requirements of justice are not seen as fixable\n\u003e in isolation from the good but as flowing from a particular conception\n\u003e of it. Equality is founded on fraternity, not vice versa. It follows\n\u003e that there can be no abstract, a priori answer, of the kind attempted\n\u003e by Rawls, to the question “how much inequality is too much?” One must\n\u003e look to the effects of inequality on the moral fabric of society, and\n\u003e on the political system in particular. Where the rich behave with\n\u003e lawless arrogance, the poor with impotent resentment and politicians\n\u003e with obeisance to money, inequality has exceeded the mark.\n\n#### Personality\n\n\u003e *Personality*. By personality we mean first of all the ability to\n\u003e frame and execute a plan of life reflective of one’s tastes,\n\u003e temperament and conception of the good. This is what Kantians call\n\u003e autonomy and Aristotelians practical reason. But the term personality\n\u003e implies something else as well, an element of spontaneity,\n\u003e individuality and spirit. Many philosophers—Kant himself springs to\n\u003e mind—have been models of rational self-government yet sadly lacking in\n\u003e personality.\n\u003e\n\u003e Why distinguish personality and respect? Are the two concepts not\n\u003e correlative: respect is paid to personality; personality calls forth\n\u003e respect? But there is a subtle difference. One can picture a\n\u003e community—a monastic order, say, or a revolutionary phalanx—where all\n\u003e property is shared, all affairs open to scrutiny, and all wills bent\n\u003e on the common good. Members of this community might hold each other in\n\u003e the highest respect yet would lack personality. Personality implies a\n\u003e private space, a “room behind the shop” as Montaigne called it, in\n\u003e which the individual is at liberty to unfurl, to be himself. It\n\u003e denotes the inward aspect of freedom, that which resists the claims of\n\u003e public reason and duty.\n\u003e\n\u003e Personality is pre-eminently a post-medieval, European ideal; it\n\u003e corresponds roughly to what the French liberal Benjamin Constant\n\u003e called “modern liberty.” But its appeal is not just local. All\n\u003e cultures have their holy fools and star-crossed lovers, honored in\n\u003e verse and song if not in real life. A society devoid of personality,\n\u003e where individuals accepted their social role without tension or\n\u003e protest, would scarcely be human. It would be more like a colony of\n\u003e intelligent social insects, of the sort envisaged in certain\n\u003e science-fiction films.\n\u003e\n\u003e There is a tendency in modern liberalism to elevate personality—or\n\u003e autonomy, as it is usually called—into the *ur*-good from which all\n\u003e others derive. Something like this underlies, as we saw, the\n\u003e reluctance of Rawls, Sen and Nussbaum to discuss final ends. We think\n\u003e this is a mistake. Autonomy is one good among others, with no special\n\u003e precedence. (It can, without obvious absurdity, be sacrificed to\n\u003e love.) Detached from any broader background of ethical concern,\n\u003e autonomy degenerates into that “liberty of indifference” for which all\n\u003e things are possible and nothing matters. The modern rhetoric of\n\u003e “choosing values” is one symptom of this confusion. Properly\n\u003e understood, choice *responds* to value. Where it is allowed to\n\u003e *create* value, its exercise becomes arbitrary—like firing arrows into\n\u003e a barn door and drawing targets around them.\n\u003e\n\u003e Private property is an essential safeguard of personality, for it\n\u003e allows individuals to live according to their own tastes and ideals,\n\u003e free from the tyranny of patronage and public opinion. “Stable\n\u003e fortunes … are an invisible social asset on which every kind of\n\u003e culture is more or less dependent,” wrote the French economist Marcel\n\u003e Labordère in a letter to Keynes. “Financial security for one’s\n\u003e livelihood is a necessary condition for organised leisure and thought.\n\u003e Organised leisure and thought is a necessary condition of a true, not\n\u003e purely mechanical, civilisation.”^17^ Note that it is specifically\n\u003e *property*, not income, that has this liberating influence. Soviet\n\u003e apparatchiks, with access to consumables of all sorts but not to\n\u003e capital, were not free to develop their personalities. Neither are\n\u003e those Wall Street traders whose huge pay packages vanish immediately\n\u003e in “necessary” expenses.^\\*^ Independence is distinct from opulence,\n\u003e and vastly more important.\n\u003e\n\u003e This “personalist” defense of property is central to modern Catholic\n\u003e social teaching, where it forms part of a subtle, two-pronged attack\n\u003e on both free-market capitalism and state socialism. The foundation was\n\u003e laid in Pope Leo XIII’s Encyclical of 1891, *Rerum Novarum*. Every\n\u003e householder, argues Leo, should possess the means of providing for\n\u003e himself and his family now and in perpetuity. To be without such means\n\u003e is to be forced into a degrading dependence on the managers of\n\u003e capital, be they private individuals or state servants. “The law,\n\u003e therefore, should favour ownership, and its policy should be to induce\n\u003e as many as possible of the people to become owners.”^18^ These ideas\n\u003e were to flow into the “distributionist” movement of early\n\u003e twentieth-century England, as well as into Christian Democratic\n\u003e thought in Germany and Italy, as we shall see in the next chapter.\n\u003e\n\u003e The personalist argument for private property is distinct from the\n\u003e standard free-market one, and has different implications. For\n\u003e mainstream economics, property is simply part of the legal\n\u003e infrastructure of capitalism. Its distribution is not fundamentally a\n\u003e matter of concern, except insofar as it leads to monopoly pricing. By\n\u003e contrast, from a personalist point of view, the concentration of\n\u003e property in a few hands violates its essential function, which is to\n\u003e provide individuals and families with an independent livelihood.\n\u003e Property must be broadly distributed, or it cannot do its ethical job.\n\u003e How such a distribution might be brought about will be a central theme\n\u003e of the next chapter.\n\n#### Harmony with Nature\n\n\u003e *Harmony with Nature*. The case for treating harmony with nature as a\n\u003e basic human good was argued for in the last chapter. But the issue\n\u003e remains controversial. Martha Nussbaum reports that some of her South\n\u003e Asian colleagues dismissed the whole idea as “a romantic Green Party\n\u003e flourish.”^19^ We have encountered a similar reaction from Chinese\n\u003e friends. There is no denying the proneness of modern Westerners to wax\n\u003e sentimental over nature, sometimes to the extent of overlooking the\n\u003e weightier demands of human suffering. Nonetheless, a sense of kinship\n\u003e with animals, plants and landscapes is hardly a Western peculiarity.\n\u003e The abundance of nature poetry in Sanskrit, classical Chinese and\n\u003e other languages around the world is sufficient proof of that.\n\u003e\n\u003e Harmony with nature has often been understood to favor rural over\n\u003e urban life. Ever since the days of Babylon and Rome, cities have\n\u003e appeared as sinks of squalor and vice. But the opposite point of view\n\u003e has also had its defenders. Socrates found all the wisdom he needed\n\u003e within the walls of Athens. Marx spoke of the idiocy of rural life.\n\u003e There is no need for us to enter into this old debate; both sides have\n\u003e some truth to them. What is new, however, is the sheer scale of the\n\u003e modern city. An inhabitant of eighteenth-century Paris, then the\n\u003e largest city in the world, had only to walk thirty minutes to find\n\u003e himself in farmland. His modern equivalent would have to walk six\n\u003e hours through crowded traffic. Here is the source of that typically\n\u003e modern feeling of urban malaise and that yearning, often comic in its\n\u003e effects, to “get back to nature.” The ill-effects of urban\n\u003e overcrowding on behavior and mood have been well documented by\n\u003e psychologists.\n\u003e\n\u003e Should we abolish the modern city, then? With current population\n\u003e densities, such a policy would only succeed in transforming the\n\u003e country into a vast suburb. But we *should* strive to ensure that\n\u003e cities are not entirely alienated from their rural surroundings. For\n\u003e millennia, local food markets served as the main point of contact\n\u003e between town and country. These are now largely gone, and with them\n\u003e all sense of place and season. The modern British foodie can tickle\n\u003e his jaded palate with Japanese tempura, Sichuan chili, Moroccan\n\u003e couscous and a host of other pickings from the global storehouse, all\n\u003e equally detached from any context of meaning. Alienation from nature\n\u003e is just one of the unpriced costs of consumer choice.\n\n#### Friendship\n\n\u003e *Friendship*. This is a necessarily inadequate translation of the\n\u003e ancient Greek *philia*, a term encompassing all robust, affectionate\n\u003e relationships. A father, spouse, teacher and workmate might all be\n\u003e “friends” in our sense of the term. As mentioned above, this might\n\u003e seem to blur a crucial distinction between family relations, which are\n\u003e unchosen, and friendships in the strict sense, which are elective. But\n\u003e examined closely, the distinction is not so clear-cut. All family\n\u003e relationships have an elective element—beyond a certain point, one has\n\u003e to *work* at being a mother or a sister—and all deep non-family\n\u003e relationships have a binding force, often expressed by the extension\n\u003e to them of family terms: blood-brother, mother superior and so forth.\n\u003e Family and other personal relations vary in structure and importance\n\u003e from culture to culture, but some such relations are clearly essential\n\u003e to any conceivable version of the good life. “No one would choose to\n\u003e live without friends,” noted Aristotle, “even if he had the other good\n\u003e things.”^20^\n\u003e\n\u003e Why do we speak of “friendship” instead of “community,” a word that\n\u003e has become horribly popular in recent decades? Our concern has to do\n\u003e with reification. It is all too easy to talk about the “good of the\n\u003e community” as though this were something over and above the good of\n\u003e its constituent members. The term “friendship” is not open to this\n\u003e kind of abuse. My friendship with Paul is clearly a *relation* between\n\u003e me and Paul; it does not float above us, ghost-like, with interests\n\u003e and rights all of its own. If we could learn to think of communities\n\u003e in this fashion, as networks of friends, one notorious source of\n\u003e political oppression would be removed.\n\u003e\n\u003e Friendship was taken seriously in the ancient world. Aristotle, in his\n\u003e classic discussion of the subject, distinguishes friendship proper\n\u003e from utility-friendship (based on a coincidence of interests) and\n\u003e pleasure-friendship (based on shared amusements). True friendship\n\u003e exists when each party embraces the other’s good as his own, thereby\n\u003e bringing into being a new *common* good. It is a relationship possible\n\u003e only between people of virtue, who love one another for what they are,\n\u003e not for what they can offer. Friendship is both personal and\n\u003e political. It binds together members of a family and, by extension,\n\u003e citizens of a *polis*. It is “the greatest good of states and what\n\u003e best preserves them against revolutions.”^21^ These words sound\n\u003e strange to modern ears. We are used to thinking of the state as an\n\u003e alliance of self-interested individuals, and of friendship as a purely\n\u003e private relationship, of no political significance. But from\n\u003e Aristotle’s point of view, a state without friendship is no state at\n\u003e all. A state is not “a mere society … established for the prevention\n\u003e of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange.” It is “the union of\n\u003e families and villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which\n\u003e we mean a happy and honourable life.”^22^\n\u003e\n\u003e Writing a hundred and fifty years before Aristotle, on the other side\n\u003e of the world, Confucius nonetheless shared his belief in the political\n\u003e importance of personal relationships. “Those who in private life\n\u003e behave well towards their parents and elder brothers, in public life\n\u003e seldom show a disposition to resist the authority of their\n\u003e superiors.”^23^ But the resemblance is superficial only. Confucius’\n\u003e focus is on deference to authority, not participation in shared goods.\n\u003e And whereas Aristotle subsumes the family under the broader heading of\n\u003e *philia*, the Chinese philosopher singles it out for special\n\u003e commendation. “Surely proper behaviour towards parents and elder\n\u003e brothers is the trunk of Goodness?”^24^ These differences of attitude\n\u003e are still visible today. Western children often grow up to view their\n\u003e parents as “friends” in the narrow sense, whereas in China the\n\u003e relationship remains one of mutual love and sacrifice throughout life.\n\u003e\n\u003e Friendship is not primarily an economic good, but it has economic\n\u003e prerequisites. Social trust does not flourish in times of famine. And\n\u003e an economy marked by continual restructuring, downsizing and\n\u003e outsourcing will not be hospitable to deep, long-lasting\n\u003e relationships. “You need to rid your life of Leeches and replace them\n\u003e with Energizers,” writes American lifestyle coach Robert Pagliarini, a\n\u003e message reiterated in countless self-help books and websites.^25^ In\n\u003e Aristotelian terms, friends acquired with the specific aim of\n\u003e “energizing” oneself are not real friends at all, but utility friends.\n\u003e Still, they are a predictable feature of a culture that prizes\n\u003e autonomy and mobility above almost all else.\n\n#### Leisure\n\n\u003e *Leisure*. In contemporary parlance, leisure is synonymous with\n\u003e relaxation and rest. But there is another, older conception of\n\u003e leisure, according to which it is not just time off work but a special\n\u003e form of activity in its own right. **Leisure in this sense is that\n\u003e which we do for its own sake, not as a means to something else.** The\n\u003e philosopher Leo Strauss wrote of his friend Kurt Riezler that “the\n\u003e activity of his mind had the character of noble and serious employment\n\u003e of leisure, not of harried labor.”^26^ It is in this sense that we\n\u003e wish “leisure” to be understood.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Leisure in our sense has no very close connection to leisure as it\n\u003e is generally understood**. Paid work could be leisure in our sense if\n\u003e undertaken not primarily as a means to money but for its own sake.\n\u003e (Many writers would carry on writing even if they earned nothing for\n\u003e it, or could earn more doing something else.) Conversely, many\n\u003e “leisure activities” are not leisure in our sense, either because they\n\u003e are undertaken instrumentally—playing squash to lose weight, for\n\u003e instance—or because they are too passive to count as *action* at all.\n\u003e (**Watching television and getting drunk are actions only in the\n\u003e minimal sense that everything we do is an action. They lack the\n\u003e spontaneity and skill characteristic of action in the full sense, and\n\u003e are therefore best viewed as “rest” rather than leisure.**) Leisure in\n\u003e our sense is distinguished not by lack of seriousness or strenuousness\n\u003e but by absence of external compulsion. It thus comes close to what\n\u003e Marx called non-alienated labor, which he defined as “a free\n\u003e manifestation of life, hence an enjoyment of life.”^27^\n\u003e\n\u003e The importance of leisure has been recognized by civilizations across\n\u003e the world. The three great Abrahamic religions all set aside a weekly\n\u003e Sabbath or day of rest, though this is not quite leisure in our sense,\n\u003e being primarily for the purpose of worship, not free activity.^28^\n\u003e Aristotle came closer in his distinction between the “liberal” and\n\u003e “mechanical” arts, the former being those suitable to freemen, the\n\u003e later to workmen and slaves (“We call those arts mechanical which tend\n\u003e to deform the body, and likewise all paid employments, for they absorb\n\u003e and degrade the mind”).^29^ But it was in Edo Japan that the\n\u003e cultivation of leisure was taken furthest. Deprived by centuries of\n\u003e peace of its traditional occupations, the feudal aristocracy turned\n\u003e instead to the arts of life, transforming everyday activities like\n\u003e bathing and tea drinking into exquisite ceremonies. The French\n\u003e philosopher Alexandre Kojève looked to Japan as the first successful\n\u003e “post-historical” society. We may hope, he wrote, tongue only\n\u003e partially in cheek, “that the recently begun interaction between Japan\n\u003e and the Western World will finally lead not to a rebarbarization of\n\u003e the Japanese but to a ‘Japanization’ of the Westerners.”^30^\n\u003e\n\u003e Why is leisure a basic good? **The reason is clear: a life without\n\u003e leisure, where everything is done for the sake of something else, is\n\u003e vain indeed.** It is a life spent always in preparation, never in\n\u003e actual living. Leisure is the wellspring of higher thought and\n\u003e culture, for it is only when emancipated from the pressure of need\n\u003e that we really *look* at the world, ponder it in its distinct\n\u003e character and outline. (The ancient Greek for leisure, *schole*, hints\n\u003e at this connection.) “When we really let our minds rest\n\u003e contemplatively on a rose in bud, on a child at play, on a divine\n\u003e mystery, we are rested and quickened as though by a dreamless sleep,”\n\u003e writes Josef Pieper. “It is in these silent and receptive moments that\n\u003e the soul of man is sometimes visited by an awareness of what holds the\n\u003e world together.”^31^ Without leisure, there is no genuine, but only\n\u003e that “mechanical,” civilization spoken of by Marcel Labordère. The\n\u003e modern university, with its machinery of “targets” and “outputs,”\n\u003e embodies this grim spectre.\n\u003e\n\u003e Such a conception of leisure may seem narrowly highbrow, but that is\n\u003e not the intention. All recreations involving active, skilled\n\u003e participation—playing football in the park, making and decorating\n\u003e one’s own furniture, strumming the guitar with friends—are leisure in\n\u003e our sense. What matters is not the intellectual level of the activity,\n\u003e but its character of “purposiveness without purpose.”\n\u003e\n\u003e What are the economic conditions of leisure? First of all, a reduction\n\u003e of *toil*, a category that includes not just paid work but all\n\u003e necessary activity, including commuting and housework, and excludes\n\u003e paid work undertaken primarily for its own sake, such as that of the\n\u003e devoted writer or artisan. Where toil occupies so great a portion of\n\u003e one’s day as to leave time only for sleep and rest, leisure is\n\u003e impossible. But a mere reduction of toil is not sufficient for leisure\n\u003e in our sense, as the figure of Keynes’s bored housewife suggests. To\n\u003e live “wisely and agreeably and well” requires not just time but\n\u003e application and taste. It is ironic, if unsurprising, that the old\n\u003e arts of life—conversation, dancing, music-making—are atrophying just\n\u003e when we have most need of them. An economy geared to maximizing\n\u003e marketable output will tend to produce manufactured rather than\n\u003e spontaneous forms of leisure.\n\n### Realising the Basic Goods\n\n#### The role of the state …\n\n\u003e If the first goal of the individual is to realize the good life for\n\u003e himself, the first duty of the state is to realize, insofar as lies\n\u003e within its power, the good life for all citizens. (This principle of\n\u003e justice is founded on the good of mutual respect, as discussed above.)\n\u003e The qualification “insofar as lies within its power” is important.\n\u003e Health and friendship lie largely in the lap of fate. Personality,\n\u003e respect and leisure depend partly on individual agency. Still, the\n\u003e state has an important and legitimate role in creating the *material\n\u003e conditions* under which these and other goods can flourish. Such\n\u003e conditions include not just a certain overall level of national wealth\n\u003e but its just distribution, its wise public expenditure and much more\n\u003e besides. The rest lies in the hands of individuals and civil\n\u003e institutions. To adapt a phrase of Keynes, the state is the trustee\n\u003e not of civilization but of the possibility of civilization.\n\n#### Health\n\n-   *Health*. **Average life expectancy** in Britain rose by just over\n    \u003e seven years from 1974 to 2009. This increase owes little to\n    \u003e growth, however. Life expectancy has improved in almost all\n    \u003e countries over this period, regardless of growth rates, mainly as\n    \u003e a result of advances in medical technology and infrastructure.^36^\n    \u003e China and Brazil now trail the West by only six or seven years,\n    \u003e while Cuba, one of the poorer nations of the world, boasts a life\n    \u003e expectancy equal to that of the USA. Moreover, as argued above,\n    \u003e mere *length of life is a poor index of health*, since it tells us\n    \u003e nothing about *quality*. “The good life is surely not measured by\n    \u003e its length in years,” wrote an 86-year-old James Lovelock, “but by\n    \u003e the intensity of the joy and good consequences of existence.”^37^\n\n-   health may actually be deteriorating with affluence\n\n    -   Alcohol-related deaths, obesity, prescriptions for depression,\n        \u003e rise in depression, work-related stress\n\n    -   By historical standards, we remain extremely healthy, but the\n        \u003e old assurance that this state of affairs would continue in\n        \u003e perpetuity is fading\n\n#### Security\n\n-   Full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy was abandoned\n    \u003e during the Reagan/Thatcher era and has not been reinstated.\n\n-   In Britain and the USA, **jobs for life have increasingly been\n    \u003e replaced by temporary or open contracts**. Job tenure for British\n    \u003e men fell 20 percent from 1975 to 1995.\n\n-   At the same time, there has been a marked **growth in temporary**,\n    \u003e especially agency, workers, whose numbers have doubled since 1992\n\n-   These trends are partly structural, an effect of the ongoing shift\n    \u003e from industry to services, but they have been exacerbated\n    \u003e by policy. Security has been regarded as a legitimate sacrifice to\n    \u003e the greater good of growth, not as a basic human need.\n\n-   TODO: What about other aspects, such as crime, war, …?\n\n#### Respect\n\n-   The greatest barrier to mutual respect in most Western nations is\n    \u003e the **emergence**, beginning in the 1970s, **of a permanent body\n    \u003e of state dependants**.^\\*^ Once shielded by a residue of Christian\n    \u003e and social democratic sentiment, “chavs” and “scroungers” are now\n    \u003e treated with open contempt in the press and on television. Another\n    \u003e barrier to mutual respect is **excessive inequality**. This\n    \u003e destroys respect not just for those at the bottom, but also those\n    \u003e at the top, especially if their advantages are perceived\n    \u003e as unmerited. Inequality has risen in most Western countries since\n    \u003e the 1970s, in Britain and the USA especially, as Chart 12 shows.\n    \u003e This trend is partly a function of autonomous social forces, but\n    \u003e the slashing of the top rate of income tax under Thatcher and\n    \u003e Reagan undoubtedly accentuated it.\n\n-   Finally, the “**turbo-capitalism**” enshrined in Wall Street and the\n    \u003e City of London over the last thirty years has led to a\n    \u003e brutalization of working relations. “His BlackBerry and security\n    \u003e pass are taken from him by burly men, he has no further access to\n    \u003e work email, and five minutes to clear his desk,” runs an article\n    \u003e describing the fate of an equity analyst, sacked for taking time\n    \u003e off to see his sick wife.^43^ Such scenes are all too common.\n    \u003e Today, high salaries are no security against proletarianization\n    \u003e and its attendant humiliations.\n\n#### Personality\n\n-   We have said that the **main economic safeguard of personality is\n    \u003e property**. This might seem to spell good news for Britain, where\n    \u003e home ownership rose steadily over the course of the last century\n    \u003e and now stands at 68 percent, having fallen from an all-time high\n    \u003e of 71 percent in 2003. However, since most property is bought on\n    \u003e mortgage, with outright ownership coming only late in life, if at\n    \u003e all, its **effects are anything but emancipatory**. **Mortgaged\n    \u003e property binds its owner to a regular job**. It is specifically\n    \u003e *wealth*—that is, an individual’s total assets minus his or her\n    \u003e liabilities—that confers freedom to pursue an autonomous plan\n    \u003e of life.\n\n\n-   The overall picture is not encouraging for the advocates of growth\n    \u003e at all cost. Despite the doubling of UK per capita income, we\n    \u003e possess no more of the basic goods than we did in 1974; in certain\n    \u003e respects, we possess less of them. We have chased after\n    \u003e superfluities and neglected necessities. This, incidentally, may\n    \u003e explain the “flat line” of happiness discussed in Chapter 4, if\n    \u003e indeed it is anything more than a statistical artifact. It could\n    \u003e be that people sense, correctly, that their lives are objectively\n    \u003e no better now than they were then. Jil Matheson, head of the UK\n    \u003e Office for National Statistics, has identified the things that\n    \u003e matter most for happiness as “health, relationships, work and the\n    \u003e environment”—a list that tallies closely with our basic goods.^55^\n    \u003e Given that our lives have not noticeably improved in these\n    \u003e respects since 1974, it is hardly surprising that we do not feel\n    \u003e any happier.\n\nChapter 7:  Exits from the Rat Race\n-----------------------------------\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var b=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(i,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),g=(i,e)=\u003e{for(var t in e)a(i,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},s=(i,e,t,o)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let r of b(e))!m.call(i,r)\u0026\u0026r!==t\u0026\u0026a(i,r,{get:()=\u003ee[r],enumerable:!(o=u(e,r))||o.enumerable});return i};var w=(i,e,t)=\u003e(t=i!=null?c(p(i)):{},s(e||!i||!i.__esModule?a(t,\"default\",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):t,i)),y=i=\u003es(a({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),i);var h=f((L,l)=\u003e{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var x={};g(x,{default:()=\u003eq,frontmatter:()=\u003ev});var n=w(h()),v={author:[\"rufuspollock\"],posted:\"https://lifeitself.org/2017/02/05/summary-how-much-is-enough-skidelsky-2012/\"};function d(i){let e=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",p:\"p\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",br:\"br\",ol:\"ol\",li:\"li\",h3:\"h3\",em:\"em\",ul:\"ul\",strong:\"strong\",h4:\"h4\"},i.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.h1,{id:\"how-much-is-enough--summary\",children:\"How Much is Enough \\u2013 Summary\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"overview\",children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#overview\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Overview\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Chapter headings:\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.div,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(e.blockquote,{className:\"blockquote\",children:[`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"1.
