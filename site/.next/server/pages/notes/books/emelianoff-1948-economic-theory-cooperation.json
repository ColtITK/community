First, coops have no way to take equity which makes raising capital hard. Second, marketing is hard both because of lack of capital, and, more significantly, the issue of how to capture and allocate value added in a team (marketing is something that benefits everyone but it is hard to assess). Third, the disciple issue relates to basic problem of teamwork in egalitarian teams.\n\np.24 of Theory of Cooperation\n\n> Two ever-recurring assumptions underlie the generally professed ideology of the productive associations, says Dr. Fuchs:  \n> \n> a) emancipation of labor from the yoke of capital through productive associations, and  \n> b) the securing by the workingmen of the \"whole product of their   labor\" after elimination of the capitalistic entrepreneur in the productive associations.  \n> \n> The productive association, therefore, is assumed as representing an industrial form of the coming economic era; it is \"an anticipation of the future.\" Further, productive associations have always played an extraordinary role in the interpretations of cooperation and a miserable part in actual life.
