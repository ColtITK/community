Soem obvious answers about immediacy, comprehensibility etc. Climate change is long-term, distributed, uncertain etc (frog boiling ...).\n\nBut it would seem that would be an important focus for learning and action.\n\n## Political Impotence\n\n> A central concept in ecology is density feedback (Herrando-Pérez et al., 2012)—as a population approaches its environmental carrying capacity, average individual fitness declines (Brook and Bradshaw, 2006). This tends to push populations toward an instantaneous expression of carrying capacity that slows or reverses population growth. But for most of history, human ingenuity has inflated the natural environment's carrying capacity for us by developing new ways to increase food production (Hopfenberg, 2003), expand wildlife exploitation, and enhance the availability of other resources. This inflation has involved modifying temperature via shelter, clothing, and microclimate control, transporting goods from remote locations, and generally reducing the probability of death or injury through community infrastructure and services (Cohen, 1995). But with the availability of fossil fuels, our species has pushed its consumption of nature's goods and services much farther beyond long-term carrying capacity (or more precisely, the planet's biocapacity), making the readjustment from overshoot that is inevitable far more catastrophic if not managed carefully (Nyström et al., 2019). A growing human population will only exacerbate this, leading to greater competition for an ever-dwindling resource pool. The corollaries are many: continued reduction of environmental intactness (Bradshaw et al., 2010; Bradshaw and Di Minin, 2019), reduced child health (especially in low-income nations) (Bradshaw et al., 2019), increased food demand exacerbating environmental degradation via agro-intensification (Crist et al., 2017), vaster and possibly catastrophic effects of global toxification (Cribb, 2014; Swan and Colino, 2021), greater expression of social pathologies (Levy and Herzog, 1974) including violence exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation itself (Agnew, 2013; White, 2017, 2019), more terrorism (Coccia, 2018), and an economic system even more prone to sequester the remaining wealth among fewer individuals (Kus, 2016; Piketty, 2020) much like how cropland expansion since the early 1990s has disproportionately concentrated wealth among the super-rich (Ceddia, 2020). The predominant paradigm is still one of pegging “environment” against “economy”; yet in reality, the choice is between exiting overshoot by design or disaster—because exiting overshoot is inevitable one way or another.\n\n## Changing the Rules of the Game\n\n> While it is neither our intention nor capacity in this short Perspective to delve into the complexities and details of possible solutions to the human predicament, there is no shortage of evidence-based literature proposing ways to change human behavior for the benefit of all extant life. The remaining questions are less about what to do, and more about how, stimulating the genesis of many organizations devoted to these pursuits (e.g., ipbes.org, goodanthropocenes.net, overshootday.org, mahb.stanford.edu, populationmatters.org, clubofrome.org, steadystate.org, to name a few). The gravity of the situation requires fundamental changes to global capitalism, education, and equality, which include inter alia the abolition of perpetual economic growth, properly pricing externalities, a rapid exit from fossil-fuel use, strict regulation of markets and property acquisition, reigning in corporate lobbying, and the empowerment of women. These choices will necessarily entail difficult conversations about population growth and the necessity of dwindling but more equitable standards of living.\n\nWhat is that literature providing \"evidence-base\" for ways to change human behaviour. In particular, which of them address the cognito-emotional-behaviour aspects?\n\n### Key actions\n\n> The gravity of the situation requires fundamental changes to global capitalism, education, and equality, which include inter alia the abolition of perpetual economic growth, properly pricing externalities, a rapid exit from fossil-fuel use, strict regulation of markets and property acquisition, reigning in corporate lobbying, and the empowerment of women.\n\nA decent high level list.\n\n### Population growth\n\nLike they are up front about population growth and declining material consumption.\n\n> These choices will necessarily entail difficult conversations about population growth and the necessity of dwindling but more equitable standards of living.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var d=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(a,e)=>()=>(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(a,e)=>{for(var n in e)o(a,n,{get:e[n],enumerable:!0})},l=(a,e,n,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let t of p(e))!m.call(a,t)&&t!==n&&o(a,t,{get:()=>e[t],enumerable:!(r=u(e,t))||r.enumerable});return a};var b=(a,e,n)=>(n=a!=null?d(g(a)):{},l(e||!a||!a.__esModule?o(n,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):n,a)),v=a=>l(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var h=f((L,s)=>{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var q={};w(q,{default:()=>x});var i=b(h());function c(a){let e=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",p:\"p\",a:\"a\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",h3:\"h3\"},a.components);return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.h1,{id:\"underestimating-the-challenges-of-avoiding-a-ghastly-future\",children:\"Underestimating the Challenges of Avoiding a Ghastly Future\"}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2020.615419/full\",children:\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2020.615419/full\"})}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"#climate crisis\"}),`\n`,(0,i.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"failed-international-goals-and-prospects-for-the-future\",children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#failed-international-goals-and-prospects-for-the-future\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Failed International Goals and Prospects for the Future\"]}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.div,{children:(0,i.jsxs)(e.blockquote,{className:\"blockquote\",children:[`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Stopping biodiversity loss is nowhere close to the top of any country's priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment, healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability.\"}),`\n`]})}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Interesting question is: why is that?
