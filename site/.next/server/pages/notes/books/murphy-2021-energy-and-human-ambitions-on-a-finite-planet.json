And even if we ignore the practical hardships,how much time would a second planet buy us anyway for uninterruptedgrowth? Another 35 years?\n\n### Hard Energy Limits\n\n> The sun deposits energy at Earth’s surface at a rate of about 1,000 W/m2(1,000 Watts per square meter; we’ll reach a better understanding for these units in Chapter 5). Ignoring clouds, the projected area intercepting the sun’s rays is justA�πR2⊕, whereR⊕is the radius of the earth, around 6,400 km. Roughly a quarter of the earth’s surface is land, and adding it all up we get about30×1015W hitting land. If we put solar panels on every square meter of land converting sunlight to electrical energy at 20% efficiency we keep 6×1015W. This is a little over 300 times the current global energy usage rate of 18 TW. What an encouraging number! Lots of margin. How long before our growth would get us there? After one century, we’re 10 times higher, and 100 times higher after two centuries. It would take about 2.5 centuries (250 years) to hit this limit. Then no more energy growth.\n\n### The Magic of Technology can fool us it will be like that forever\n\n### Decoupling and substituion won't cut it\n\n> In summary, decoupling and substitution are touted as mechanismsby which economic growth need not slow down as energy and otherresources become constrained. We can make money using less of theresource (decoupling) or just find alternatives that are not constrained(substitution), the thinking goes. And yes, this is backed up by loadsof examples where such thingshavehappened. It would be foolish toclaim that we have reached the end of the line and can expectnomoregains from decoupling or substitution. But it would be equally foolishto imagine that they can produce dividends eternally so that economicgrowth is a permanent condition.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var f=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,w=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var m=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),p=(n,e)=>{for(var i in e)a(n,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},l=(n,e,i,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let o of f(e))!w.call(n,o)&&o!==i&&a(n,o,{get:()=>e[o],enumerable:!(r=u(e,o))||r.enumerable});return n};var b=(n,e,i)=>(i=n!=null?c(g(n)):{},l(e||!n||!n.__esModule?a(i,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):i,n)),y=n=>l(a({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var s=m((H,h)=>{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var j={};p(j,{default:()=>x});var t=b(s());function d(n){let e=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",p:\"p\",a:\"a\",h3:\"h3\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\"},n.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.h1,{id:\"xxx-by-tom-murphy-2021\",children:\"XXX by Tom Murphy (2021)\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m\",children:\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m\"})}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"Book in the spirit of Without the Hot Air but on broader themes of sustainability.
