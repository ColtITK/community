It is an updating of \"dependency theory\" focused on a \"core-periphery\" relationship between a rich, developed economic core and a poor, dependent, exploited periphery. In a more general sense, it defines the concept of a \"world system\": a geographical region (which could be the world) with a singular division of labour, coherent political and bureaucratic structures and one or more cultures.\n\n## Definition\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\u003e Wallerstein offers several definitions of a world-system, defining it in 1974 briefly:\n\u003e \n\u003e\u003e a system is defined as a unit with a single division of labor and multiple cultural systems.[22]\n\u003e \n\u003e He also offered a longer definition:\n\u003e \n\u003e\u003e ...a social system, one that has boundaries, structures, member groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence. Its life is made up of the conflicting forces which hold it together by tension and tear it apart as each group seeks eternally to remold it to its advantage. It has the characteristics of an organism, in that it has a life-span over which its characteristics change in some respects and remain stable in others. One can define its structures as being at different times strong or weak in terms of the internal logic of its functioning.\n\u003e \n\u003e In 1987, Wallerstein again defined it:\n\u003e \n\u003e\u003e ... not the system of the world, but a system that is a world and which can be, most often has been, located in an area less than the entire globe. World-systems analysis argues that the units of social reality within which we operate, whose rules constrain us, are for the most part such world-systems (other than the now extinct, small minisystems that once existed on the earth). World-systems analysis argues that there have been thus far only two varieties of world-systems: world-economies and world empires. A world-empire (examples, the Roman Empire, Han China) are large bureaucratic structures with a single political center and an axial division of labor, but multiple cultures. A world-economy is a large axial division of labor with multiple political centers and multiple cultures. In English, the hyphen is essential to indicate these concepts. \"World system\" without a hyphen suggests that there has been only one world-system in the history of the world.\n\n## References\n\n* Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D.
