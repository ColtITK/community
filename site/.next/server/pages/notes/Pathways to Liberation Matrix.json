Created by Jacob Gotwals, Jack Lehman, Jim Manske and Jori Manske between 2008 and 2011 it comes from the [[NVC]] world but is broadly applicable. From the website https://pathwaystoliberation.com/the-matrix/:\n\n> The Pathways to Liberation: Matrix of Self-Assessment (“the Matrix”) was developed to support self-assessment of the skills and consciousness of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). The Matrix is a collaborative project created by Jacob Gotwals, Jack Lehman, Jim Manske and Jori Manske. In 2008 we started writing about skills for transforming life and relationships, in the service of creating a world of personal and systemic wellbeing and collaboration. We worked together for 3 years to create a list of skills and a measure of their development from unknown to integrated.\n\n## Materials\n\nYou can find the matrix in multiple languages on: https://pathwaystoliberation.com/the-matrix/\n\n- English spreadsheet version (latest): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KPIvCD_XIGThKEsqZ-qKQwY0Op5pSe_r7uqksetW5FQ/edit#gid=10\n- Online self-assessment with backing database: https://pathwaystoliberation.com/the-matrix-instructions/\n- [Pathways-to-Liberation-Self-Assessment-Matrix.pdf](https://github.com/life-itself/community/files/9932721/Pathways-to-Liberation-Self-Assessment-Matrix.pdf)\n\n## Comments\n\n- Very solid set of characteristics\n- Big bonus is that it is openly licensed under Creative Commons attribution license.\n\n(h/t to Karl Steyaert for flagging this to me).\n\n## Full list of qualities and their short descriptions\n\n- Presence: Being attentive to what is happening right now. Not lost in thinking, emotional reactions, etc.\n- Observing: Noticing (and possibly describing) our sensory and mental experiences, and distinguishing these experiences from the interpretations we ascribe to them.\n- Feelings Awareness: Ability to identify and experience our physical sensations and emotions.\n- Self-acceptance: Accepting oneself with unconditional caring.\n- Taking ownership of one's feelings: Living from the knowledge that I alone cause my emotions - my emotions are not caused by others.\n- Needs consciousness:   Awareness of (and the willingness to honor) needs, the essential universal elemental qualities of life (like sustenance, love and meaning).\n- Reconnecting to self and recovering from reactivity: Reactivity is internal resistance to what is. Recovery is letting go of that resistance. Re-connecting to self is being with one's own experience with presence and compassion.\n- Request consciousness & making requests: Willingness to ask for what one wants, with openness to any response; not attached to any particular outcome.\n- Mourning: Transforming the suffering of loss; letting go of resistance to what is, and being willing to allow our experience to unfold.\n- Empathy: Being present with another's experience, with unconditional acceptance of the person.\n- Dissolving enemy images: Transcending one's perceptions that another deserves to be punished or harmed.\n- Discernment: Clarity, insight, and wisdom in making life-serving distinctions and choices; recognizing one has choice.\n- Living interdependently: Living from the knowledge that every individual is related to every other individual - every part of a system affects every other part.\n- Honest self-expression: Owning one's experience and having the willingness to express authentically without blame or criticism.\n- Facilitating connection: Facilitating empathy and honesty in dialogue with an intent to create connection.\n- Patience: Remaining spaciously present when one feels stress. An ability to be with one's own reactions, without acting out of them.\n- Responding to others' reactivity: Responding rather than reacting to others who are caught up in intense separating emotions.\n- Openness to feedback: Receiving other's perspective about our actions with equanimity and centeredness.\n- Beneficial regret: Acknowledging and learning from one's missed opportunity to meet needs, without guilt, shame, or self-punishment.\n- Flexibility in relating: Openness and versatility in interacting with others.\n- Transforming conflict: Using conflict with others as a means to connect and create a mutual outcome.\n- Gratitude: Finding the value in, appreciating, and enjoying what is.\n- Open-hearted flow of giving and receiving: Transforming scarcity thinking into thriving creatively; joyfully contributing and receiving.\n- Cultivating vitality: Tuning in to oneself to support balanced self-care; cultivating the energy to serve life.\n- Sharing power: Transforming domination; valuing everyone's needs with mutuality and respect; transcending submission and rebellion.\n- Transcending roles: Aware that we are not the roles we play; having choice about what roles we adopt and how we respond to the roles others adopt.\n- Awareness of response-ability: Freely choosing one's responses to what shows up in life, owning one's part in what happens. Not owning others' parts, and acknowledging that one's actions do influence others.\n- Supporting holistic systems: Consciously participating in the creation and evolution of holistic systems that foster general well-being.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var d=Object.create;var a=Object.defineProperty;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var m=Object.getPrototypeOf,u=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(i,e)=>()=>(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(i,e)=>{for(var t in e)a(i,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},l=(i,e,t,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let s of p(e))!u.call(i,s)&&s!==t&&a(i,s,{get:()=>e[s],enumerable:!(o=g(e,s))||o.enumerable});return i};var v=(i,e,t)=>(t=i!=null?d(m(i)):{},l(e||!i||!i.__esModule?a(t,\"default\",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):t,i)),y=i=>l(a({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),i);var h=f((q,r)=>{r.exports=_jsx_runtime});var L={};w(L,{default:()=>k,frontmatter:()=>b});var n=v(h()),b={title:\"Pathways to Liberation Matrix of Assessment\",authors:[\"rufuspollock\"],url:\"https://pathwaystoliberation.com/the-matrix/\"};function c(i){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\"},i.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:['A matrix of 28 skills and development \"levels\" in those skills.
