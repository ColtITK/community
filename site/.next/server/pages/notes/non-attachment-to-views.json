As a\nresult, we find it hard to change our views and to hear others. This can\nresult in dogmatism, fanaticism and even violence both physical and\nemotional. At a personal level, our attachment to views may be one of\nthe greatest obstacle to our own well-being and enlightenment because of\nthe difficulty we face relinquishing deep-rooted beliefs in an\ninherently existing ‘self’ or ‘I’.[^2]\n\nIn this primer we look at three areas related to this issue. First, we\nlook at what we mean by attachment and non-attachment to views and their\nrelationship to engagement and detachment. We clarify that\nnon-attachment is not **de-**attachment but rather un-attached\nengagement and open-mindedness.\n\nSecond, we present the scientific evidence that we are attached to\nviews: that we resist changing our views despite strong, contrary\nevidence. We discuss various reasons why that might be and the impact of\nthis materially and spiritually.\n\nThird, we explore the deeper connections with ontology and our ideas of\nself in philosophy and Buddhism.\n\n## What are Attachment and Non-Attachment?\n\nOrdinarily we think of attachment as something positive or even neutral:\nI’m attached to this old watch because my father gave it to me, or the\nboat is attached to the shore by a rope. And conversely to be unattached\noffers sounds a bit negative. For example, if you say “I’m unattached”\nit means you are without a romantic relationship — whereas to be\nattached is to have one (observe that common slang for getting married\nis to “get hitched” which roughly approximates to to “get attached”).\n\nAnd this sense is still there when it comes to views. Not to be attached\nto a view is to be *de*-tached. Whilst there can be a positive sense of\ndispassionate and independent as in “the judge considered the arguments\nwith a sense of detachment”, there is also the sense of uninvolved and\nuncaring: “the man watched the dogs attack the fox with an air of\ndetachment”.\n\nThus our use of attachment may be surprising. In ordinary english\nattachment is often used in as positive context: we are attached to\nplaces, people and things that we like and care about. Conversely, the\nopposite of attachment — *de*tachment — has a mildly negative sense of\nemotionless unconcern, anomie, lifelessness — “he kissed her with an air\nof detachment”, “he lived detached, absent, as if something were\npermanently missing”.\n\nOur use of attachment and non-attachment are somewhat special and rather\nspecific. It derives from a Buddhist tradition. In that tradition\n“attachment” is the translation for key concept around the way that we\n“cling” to things: experiences, things, ideas, even consciousness. It\ncan be found as a key phrase in translations of the Four Noble Truths,\nthe core teachings of the Buddha[^3]:\n\n1.  Life involves suffering\n\n2.  Suffering arises from *attachment* \\[also translated as “craving”,\n    > “clinging to” …\\]\n\n3.  Suffering ceases when *attachment* ceases\n\n4.  Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path\n\nThe special usage also explains why we use *non-*attachment rather than\n*de*-tachment as the contrast to attachment. Non-attachment, which is\nour focus here, is not detachment. It is not simply an absence, a lack\nof attachment. Rather it is something positive, a positive choice that\nmakes true engagement and commitment possible.\n\nConsider an analogy with listening. When we listen to another person we\ncan listen in several ways. One way to listen is to do passively. It is\nlistening just as not talking but without really engaging with what the\nperson is saying. What they say comes in our ears but we do not really\nhear it or listen to it in a true sense. This is “detached” listening.\nOn the other hand, there are times when we truly listen and listen\ndeeply. This is an active not a passive act. Where actively engage\nourselves with what they are saying, opening our mind to it, positively\nwelcoming what they are saying.\n\n![](vault/assets/notebook/non-attachment.png)\n\n## Common garden examples of attachment\n\n### Research on Attachment to Views\n\n***Misinformation, False Beliefs and Cognition***\n\nIf we look around us: at newspapers, at our friends, even in our own\nlives, it becomes clear that misinformation is ubiquitous, and that\nfalse and erroneous beliefs are widespread and persistent.\n\nFor example, over half of all voters in Republican Primaries in 2011\nwere “birthers” who believed that President Obama was not born in the\nUnited States despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Or the fact\nthat a sizeable minority in Britain and the United States now believe,\nerroneously, in a link between vaccination and autism thanks to a single\n1998 study which was widely reported at the time but subsequently\ndiscredited. This has had a large impact for public health as parents\nrefuse to vaccinate their children resulting in a significant number of\npreventable deaths and illness.[^4]\n\nThere is now a sizeable body of scientific research on why false beliefs\npersist.\n\nWhat are we interested in?\n\n-   Conclusive evidence that a) people have false beliefs b) that these\n    > persist in face of presentation of contradictory evidence c) why\n    > that is — what cognitive and ontological mechanisms are at work d)\n    > what practical recommendations would come out of this for creating\n    > open-mindedness and non-attachment to views\n\n-   Questions: framing in terms of “false” belief and misinformation\n\n-   People don’t change views -&gt; they discard ignore or dismiss\n    > contradictory evidence -&gt; they do this because it conflicts\n    > with / threatens the security of their identity (ego) -&gt; leads\n    > us into ontology -&gt; buddhist attachment to views -&gt; becoming\n    > more open-mindedness requires addressing our attachment -&gt;\n    > buddhist practice (e.g. meditation) as this generates awareness\n    > and equanamity, which then can lead to a falling away of our\n    > attachment\n\n    -   Guarding the senses\n\nA real world impact of “attachment” (Lewandowsky et al. 2012, pp.\n106-107):\n\n> *On August 4, 1961, a young woman gave birth to a healthy baby boy in\n> a hospital at 1611 Bingham St., Honolulu. That child, Barack Obama,\n> later became the 44th president of the United States. Notwithstanding\n> the incontrovertible evidence for the simple fact of his American\n> birth—from a Hawaiian birth certificate to birth announcements in\n> local papers to the fact that his pregnant mother went into the\n> Honolulu hospital and left it cradling a baby—a group known as\n> “birthers” claimed Obama had been born outside the United States and\n> was therefore not eligible to assume the presidency. Even though the\n> claims were met with skepticism by the media, polls at the time showed\n> that they were widely believed by a sizable proportion of the public\n> (Travis, 2010), including a majority of voters in Republican primary\n> elections in 2011 (Barr, 2011).*\n>\n> *In the United Kingdom, a 1998 study suggesting a link between a\n> common childhood vaccine and autism generated considerable fear in the\n> general public concerning the safety of the vaccine. The UK Department\n> of Health and several other health organizations immediately pointed\n> to the lack of evidence for such claims and urged parents not to\n> reject the vaccine. The media subsequently widely reported that none\n> of the original claims had been substantiated. Nonetheless, in 2002,\n> between 20% and 25% of the public continued to believe in the vaccine-\n> autism link, and a further 39% to 53% continued to believe there was\n> equal evidence on both sides of the debate (Hargreaves, Lewis, &\n> Speers, 2003). More worryingly still, a substantial number of health\n> professionals continued to believe the unsub- stantiated claims\n> (Petrovic, Roberts, & Ramsay, 2001). Ulti- mately, it emerged that the\n> first author of the study had failed to disclose a significant\n> conflict of interest; thereafter, most of the coauthors distanced\n> themselves from the study, the journal offi- cially retracted the\n> article, and the first author was eventually found guilty of\n> misconduct and lost his license to practice medi- cine (Colgrove &\n> Bayer, 2005; Larson, Cooper, Eskola, Katz, & Ratzan, 2011)*[^5]*.*\n\nIt is not just the facts, it is the narrative we tell about the facts\n(“[*I don’t want to be\nright*](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right)”):\n\n> *Even when we think we’ve properly corrected a false belief, the\n> original exposure often continues to influence our memory and\n> thoughts. In a series of studies, Lewandowsky and his colleagues at\n> the University of Western Australia asked university students to read\n> the report of a liquor robbery that had ostensibly taken place in\n> Australia’s Northern Territory. Everyone read the same report, but in\n> some cases racial information about the perpetrators was included and\n> in others it wasn’t. In one scenario, the students were led to believe\n> that the suspects were Caucasian, and in another that they were\n> Aboriginal. At the end of the report, the racial information either\n> was or wasn’t retracted. Participants were then asked to take part in\n> an unrelated computer task for half an hour. After that, they were\n> asked a number of factual questions (“What sort of car was found\n> abandoned?”) and inference questions (“Who do you think the attackers\n> were?”). After the students answered all of the questions, they were\n> given a scale to assess their racial attitudes toward Aboriginals.*\n>\n> *Everyone’s memory worked correctly: the students could all recall the\n> details of the crime and could report precisely what information was\n> or wasn’t retracted. But the students who scored highest on racial\n> prejudice continued to rely on the racial misinformation that\n> identified the perpetrators as Aboriginals, even though they knew it\n> had been corrected. They answered the factual questions accurately,\n> stating that the information about race was false, and yet they still\n> relied on race in their inference responses, saying that the attackers\n> were likely Aboriginal or that the store owner likely had trouble\n> understanding them because they were Aboriginal. This was, in other\n> words, a laboratory case of the very dynamic that Nyhan identified:\n> strongly held beliefs continued to influence judgment, despite\n> correction attempts—even with a supposedly conscious awareness of what\n> was happening.*\n>\n> *In a follow-up, Lewandowsky presented a scenario that was similar to\n> the original experiment, except now, the Aboriginal was a hero who\n> disarmed the would-be robber. This time, it was students who had\n> scored lowest in racial prejudice who persisted in their reliance on\n> false information, in spite of any attempt at correction. In their\n> subsequent recollections, they mentioned race more frequently, and\n> incorrectly, even though they knew that piece of information had been\n> retracted. … *\n\n**Relation to self-identity**\n\n> *False beliefs, it turns out, have little to do with one’s stated\n> political affiliations and far more to do with **self-identity**: What\n> kind of person am I, and what kind of person do I want to be? All\n> ideologies are similarly affected. \\[emphasis added\\]*\n\nDenial vs healthy scepticism\n\n\n### A Loving Father Rejects His Son\n\n*From The Art of Power by Thich Nhat Hanh, pp.87-89*\n\nThe Buddha told the story of a merchant, a widower, who went away in a\nbusiness trip and left his little boy at home. While he was away,\nbandits came and burned down the whole village. When the merchant\nreturned, he didn’t find his house, it was just a heap of ash. There was\nthe charred body of a child close by. He threw himself on the ground and\ncried and cried. He beat his chest and pulled his hair. The next day, he\nhad the little body cremated. Because his beloved son was his only\nreason for existence, he sewed a beautiful velvet bag and put the ashes\ninside. Wherever he went, he took that bag of ashes with him. Eating,\nsleeping, working, he always carried it with him.\n\nIn fact, his son had been kidnapped by the bandits. Three months later,\nthe boy escaped and returned home. When he arrived, it was two o’clock\nin the morning. He knocked on the door of the new house his father had\nbuilt. The poor father was lying on his bed crying, holding the bag of\nashes, and he asked, ‘Who is there?’ ‘It’s me, Daddy, your son.’ The\nfather answered, ‘That’s not possible. My son is dead. I’ve cremated his\nbody and I carry his ashes with me. You must be some naughty boy who’s\ntrying to fool me. Go away, don’t disturb me!’ He refused to open the\ndoor, and there was no way for the little boy to come in. The boy had to\ngo away, and the father lost his son forever.\n\nAfter telling the story, the Buddha said, ‘If at some point in your life\nyou adopt an idea or a perception as the absolute truth, you close the\ndoor of your mind. This is the end of seeking the truth. And not only do\nyou no longer seek the truth, but even if the truth comes in person and\nknocks on your door, you refuse to open it. Attachment to views,\nattachment to ideas, attachment to perceptions are the biggest obstacle\nto the truth.’\n\n## Links\n\n-   I Don’t Want to Be Right - New Yorker\n    > [*http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right*](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right)\n\n-   Memory for Fact, Fiction, and Misinformation: The Iraq War 2003\n    > Psychological Science March 2005 16: 190-195\n\n-   Nyhan, Brendan, Jason Reifler, and Peter A.

It treats the fact of loss\nas a terrible injustice, and demands an immediate return of whatever it\nis that's been lost. It says, \"I don't want this, and I don't accept\nit.\" (Not coincidentally, \"protest crying\" is more likely to elicit a\nhostile or irritated reaction from others, since it's out of proportion,\ndisconnected from reality, and makes people feel manipulated.)\n\n\"Sad crying,\" on the other hand, expresses despair over loss. It\nexpresses our recognition that whatever's been lost is really gone, and\nexpresses our feelings of grief about it. It says, \"I don't want this,\nbut I understand that this is how it is.\" (And it's more likely to\nelicit sympathy and compassion and attachment from other people... the\ngood kind of attachment, the clinical- psychology \"connecting with\nothers\" definition of attachment, not the bad Buddhist definition.)\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n\n### Cognitive Dissonance\n\n[*http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm*](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm)\n\n### Einstellung Effect\n\nCrudely: Prior experience gets in the way of finding new ways of doing\nthings?

A team of\nchiropractors came to demonstrate the procedure. Several physician\nobservers and the chiropractors had agreed that chiropractors would\nfirst be free to illustrate applied kinesiology in whatever manner they\nchose. Afterward, we would try some double-blind tests of their claims.\n\nThe chiropractors presented as their major example a demonstration they\nbelieved showed that the human body could respond to the difference\nbetween glucose (a \"bad\" sugar) and fructose (a \"good\" sugar). The\ndifferential sensitivity was a truism among \"alternative healers,\"\nthough there was no scientific warrant for it. The chiropractors had\nvolunteers lie on their backs and raise one arm vertically. They then\nwould put a drop of glucose (in a solution of water) on the volunteer's\ntongue. The chiropractor then tried to push the volunteer's upraised arm\ndown to a horizontal position while the volunteer tried to resist. In\nalmost every case, the volunteer could not resist. The chiropractors\nstated the volunteer's body recognized glucose as a \"bad\" sugar. After\nthe volunteer's mouth was rinsed out and a drop of fructose was placed\non the tongue, the volunteer, in just about every test, resisted\nmovement to the horizontal position. The body had recognized fructose as\na \"good\" sugar.\n\nAfter lunch a nurse brought us a large number of test tubes, each one\ncoded with a secret number so that we could not tell from the tubes\nwhich contained fructose and which contained glucose. The nurse then\nleft the room so that no one in the room during the subsequent testing\nwould consciously know which tubes contained glucose and which fructose.\nThe arm tests were repeated, but this time they were double-blind --\nneither the volunteer, the chiropractors, nor the onlookers was aware of\nwhether the solution being applied to the volunteer's tongue was glucose\nor fructose. As in the morning session, sometimes the volunteers were\nable to resist and other times they were not. We recorded the code\nnumber of the solution on each trial. Then the nurse returned with the\nkey to the code. When we determined which trials involved glucose and\nwhich involved fructose, there was no connection between ability to\nresist and whether the volunteer was given the \"good\" or the \"bad\"\nsugar.\n\nWhen these results were announced, the head chiropractor turned to me\nand said, \"You see, that is why we never do double-blind testing\nanymore. It never works!\" At first I thought he was joking. It turned it\nout he was quite serious. Since he \"knew\" that applied kinesiology\nworks, and the best scientific method shows that it does not work, then\n-- in his mind -- there must be something wrong with the scientific\nmethod. This is both a form of loopholism as well as an illustration of\nwhat I call the plea for special dispensation. Many pseudo- and\nfringe-scientists often react to the failure of science to confirm their\nprized beliefs, not by gracefully accepting the possibility that they\nwere wrong, but by arguing that science is defective.\n\nSpeculation on Why We Are Attached to Views \\[Game Theory and Evolutionary Biology\\]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy do we have such strong commitment to views. In particular, why do we\nseem to emotionally involved in what we believe: finding ourselves angry\nand upset when our beliefs are threatened? (Think of that common\nagreement to have no religion or politics at the dinner table or in bars\nbecause it leads to unpleasant disagreements — even violence).\n\nHere I’m going to offer up some suggestions. These are a bit tongue in\ncheek:\n\n### Commitment problem\n\nBasic idea: emotional “attachment” to our views is a solution to a\ncommitment problem of credibility with others.\n\nAbe and Ben are hunter gatherers. Abe says to Ben: I’ve seen lots of\nnice Moose over that hill.\n\nShould Ben believe Abe and spend a day trekking over the hill to find\nthe Moose? After all:\n\nA.  Mistaken\n\n    a.  Abe could be talking out of his ass (he just says stuff like\n        > this all the time)\n\n    b.  Yes, he has some evidence but not a lot\n\nB.  Lying\n\nIf “talk is cheap” then Ben probably should not believe Abe as there is\nno reason that Abe has very high credibility — one of those three\noptions is probably true.\n\nHowever, suppose instead that talk is not cheap: that Ben knows that Abe\nreally likes to be right. That he gets upset and angry when he is wrong,\nor, that gets really guilty and stressed. Then that fact really adds\nweight to Abe’s claim. After all if Ben does go over the hill and finds\nno moose there will be an emotional cost for Abe.\n\n=&gt; This makes Ben more likely to believe Abe.\n\nAnd, of course, this emotional cost to being wrong and payoff to being\nright will not just be limited to the location of Moose. It will\nnaturally spread to include all beliefs and opinions we hazard.\n\nThis will quickly become a barrier to updating one’s views and opinions\nif it is associated with “being wrong”. Such commitments to one’s\npre-existing views and opinions will even spread to abstract ideas like\nbelief in God. It may become so emotionally welded to our sense of\nidentity and self that it is strong enough that we will kill for our\nviews and opinions — and admire those who do.\n\nFurthermore, such strong feelings create problems for changing our views\nespecially when combined with the inevitable uncertainty of life. To to\nback to our story: perhaps the moose are not always in the same place,\nso the moose being absent when Ben goes over the hill does not\nnecessarily mean that Abe was mistaken and Abe has a strong reason to\ninterpret the data that way. With uncertainty we all now we have a valid\nreason to ignore and even discard new data points that are inconsistent\nwith our pre-existing beliefs.\n\n**Aside: lying.** The above explanation talks more to option (A) case of\ngenuine mistake. However, the logic also applies in the lying case.\nLying would also potentially have evolutionary benefits — Abe wants Ben\nto go to the wrong place so that Abe gets food and Ben does not etc.\nHowever, to lie well requires you to be credible. Once again either\nhaving or being able to fake a real emotional cost to being wrong is\nvaluable. In addition, with lying the ability to deceive yourself is\nvery valuable — the best liars are the ones who believe their own lies.\nThus, the lying option would also encourage a mechanism for deceiving\nourselves. This mechanism would contribute even more to our tendency to\nignore or dismiss evidence which contradicts our pre-existing views.\n\n**Background: Commitment Problems**\n\nSuppose two robbers Abe and Ben rob a jewellery store. After the robbery\nthey need to split up to reduce their risk of being caught. In addition,\nit is best if only one of them looks after the loot. In addition, Abe\nhas all the contacts needed to sell it.\n\nHowever, Ben is worried that if Abe has the loot then he may just run\noff it with himself. What can they do?\n\nThe issue here is what game theorists like to call a time inconsistency\nproblem: at the moment just after the robbery the best thing is for them\nto split up and only one of them to hold on to the loot. But once they\nhave done that, whomever has the loot has an incentive to make off with\nit all themselves. If they cannot solve this issue they may be forced to\ndo something less optimal: split up the proceeds right now even though\nthat exposes them to more risk and they won’t get as good a price, or to\nstay together to sell the proceeds together which is even riskier.\n\nWhat is really wanted here is way for Abe to make a **credible**\ncommitment to Ben that he will not run off. This is good for both Abe\nand Ben — they will both end up with less risk and get more money.\n\nA credible commitment for Abe needs to involve something with a greater\ncost than the benefit of ripping Ben off and taking all the loot for\nhimself. One option might be that Abe’s daughter is married to Ben’s\nson. In that case, ripping Ben off will cause huge harm to his family.\nAnother option might be that Abe knows Ben is a crazy guy who will stop\nat nothing if he is taken advantage of, that Ben would track him down\nand kill him — even if that meant risking huge jail time — just to get\neven if Abe ripped him off. Though it might sound bad, Ben being crazy\nin this sense would actually be good for Abe as it would provide a way\nfor Abe to make a credible promise to Ben — Ben would know that Abe knew\nthat he is a crazy guy and would trust Abe not to rip him off.\n\n*The other classic example is nuclear weapons. Remember Dr Strangelove\nand the Russian’s Doomsday Machine*\n\nA classic issue in game theory is how to solve commitment problems.\n\n[^1]: [*http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings/*](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-5-mindfulness-trainings/)\n\n[^2]: Taken from the definition of “ontological addiction” in Shonin,\n    E., Van Gordon, W., & Griffiths, M.
