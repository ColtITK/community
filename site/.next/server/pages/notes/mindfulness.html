That is, to be aware and\npresent to what is occurring in you and around you, from your breathing\nto the fluttering of the leaves on the trees.\n\nMore specifically, mindfulness is the name for a set of practices and a\nway of approaching and being in the world. It has deep roots in ancient\nspiritual traditions, most notably Buddhism.\n\nMindfulness involves a depth and quality of awareness and being that is\ndifferent from our ordinary everyday state. Ordinarily we are occupied\nwith our thoughts, or with sensations, lost in them -- and often without\nself-conscious awareness of them even though they entirely occupy us.\nOur thoughts jump from place to place. Mindfulness involves creating\nperspective, truly attending to what is happening.\n\nCultivating it involves becoming aware of ourselves and our thoughts\nwhilst remaining with them. Metaphors help: mindfulness is the state\nwhere we can watch our thoughts wander across our minds like clouds\nacross a sky. Or, that our minds are like a glass of water with\nsediment. If you keep shaking the glass the sediment is churned up and\nthe water is muddy and opaque. If you allow the glass to become still\nthen the sediment can settle allowing the water to become clear. So\nmindfulness and meditation allow our minds to settle, bringing clarity\nand equanimity.\n\nAt the its most profound, mindfulness is a practice that enables us to\nrealise -- and experience -- important truths: that we are not our\nthoughts, that we are all interconnected(interbeing), that there is no\npermanent self.\n\nMindfulness is less an idea and more a practice or set of practices. Its\nmost basic and essential practice is meditation. Meditation is both a\nway to create mindfulness in the moment and to develop our capacity for\nmindfulness.\n\nMindfulness is not intellectual, it is not thought, in fact it involves\nus seeing that we are not (only) our thoughts, that like clouds crossing\nthe sky, they travel across the mind but are not the mind.\n\n## Background\n\nMindfulness is an idea that can be traced back millenia into ancient\nBuddhism -- and beyond. However, its recent usage in English and the\nWest can be traced to the last few decades where it has been used as a\nterm for secularized version of these traditional practices. Major\npromoters of mindfulness have intentionally sought to distance\nmindfulness from its origins in Buddhism in order to keep it separate\nfrom religion. This allows for it to be seen as neutral and more\nscientific. This, in turn, enables broader adoption both in specific\nsectors such as healthcare and education and also societally where its\nneutrality makes it acceptable to all groups whether devout or\nanti-religious.\n\nIn this context, mindfulness becomes a practice done for its near-term\n(mental) health benefits without any deeper spiritual context. This is\nsimilar to the way in which yoga has become a fitness and exercise\npractice, shorn of its original spiritual purpose and context.\n\nWhilst this can be valuable, we think it is important to retain the\ndeeper spiritual context. In any case, Buddhism, is less a religion and\nmore a philosophy or way of being -- especially in its Zen form.\nMindfulness need not have any religious overtones, but it would be a\nmistake to see it in isolation from its richer spiritual and\nphilosophical context and the approach to being and mind associated with\nit.\n\n## Practices\n\n-   Awareness of the breath and body\n-   Sitting meditation\n-   Walking meditation\n-   Deep listening: attending and listening to others without your\n    thoughts, judgments and filters interposing themselves (as much). A\n    way of hearing in which we are fully present with what is happening\n    in the moment without trying to control it or judge it.\n\n## Meditation\n\n*There are many excellent introductions to meditation. This section only\nseeks to offer a very short summary for beginners.*\n\n*We also emphasize that meditation is a practice. You need to do it to\nlearn it. Furthermore, it is a physical exercise and it is beneficial to\nsee guidance from practitioner, and if possible an expert.*\n\nMeditation is possible in any circumstance. However, it is much easier\nin some circumstances than others: for example, in quiet surroundings\nrather than noisy ones. It also requires practice, in keeping with this\ntradition highlights two major ways of doing meditation: sitting,\nwalking, eating.\n\nSitting: TODO\\\n\nWalking: TODO\n\nEating: TODO\n\n## Philosophical viewpoints\n\n-   Compassion and Loving Kindness (relation to Empathy?)\n-   Respect for all beings - Universalism. Reverence for Life.\n-   Open mindedness. Non-attachment to views. Guarding of the senses.\n-   Prudent consumption. You are what you eat. You are what you watch.\n\n## Buddhist - 4 noble truths\n\n*\"I teach suffering, its origin, cessation and path. That's all I teach\"\n- Buddha*\n\nThe Four Noble Truths contain the essence of the Buddha's teachings. It\nwas these four principles that the Buddha came to understand during his\nmeditation under the bodhi tree[^1].\n\n1.  The truth of suffering (Dukkha)\n2.  The truth of the origin of suffering (Samudāya)\n3.  The truth of the cessation of suffering (Nirodha)\n4.  The truth of the path to the cessation of suffering (Magga)\n\n[*https://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/four-noble-truths*](https://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/four-noble-truths):\n\n**1. All existence is dukkha.** The word *dukkha* has been variously\ntranslated as ‘suffering’, ‘anguish’, ‘pain’, or ‘unsatisfactoriness’.\nThe Buddha’s insight was that our lives are a struggle, and we do not\nfind ultimate happiness or satisfaction in anything we experience. This\nis the problem of existence.\n\n**2. The cause of dukkha is craving[^2].** The natural human tendency is\nto blame our difficulties on things outside ourselves. But the Buddha\nsays that their actual root is to be found in the mind itself. In\nparticular our tendency to grasp at things (or alternatively to push\nthem away) places us fundamentally at odds with the way life really is.\n\n**3. The cessation of dukkha comes with the cessation of craving.** As\nwe are the ultimate cause of our difficulties, we are also the solution.\nWe cannot change the things that happen to us, but we can change our\nresponses.\n\nexpressed as follows:\n\n**4. There is a path that leads from dukkha.** Although the Buddha\nthrows responsibility back on to the individual he also taught methods\nthrough which we can change ourselves, for example the Noble Eightfold\nPath.\n\n## Ethics\n\n-   No: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, using immoral language,\n    gossiping, slandering, giving vent to anger, holding wrong views\n    (ten evil deeds)\n\nBuddhist emphasises non-attachment above all else, even around ethics.\nOf course, avoid doing those things which are prohibited. At the same\ntime, do not get attached to these things and certainly avoid *judging*\nothers.\n\nThe story of 2 monks who come to a river. There is a beautiful woman who\ncannot cross. The older monk carries her across and puts her down on the\nother side. The two monks walk on. An hour later the young one bursts\nout: you broke our precepts by carrying that young woman. The older one\nsays: I put her down an hour ago but you are still carrying her.\n\n## Recommended Reading \u0026 Watching\n\n-   Three Pillars of Zen - really solid introduction on the\n    practical side.
