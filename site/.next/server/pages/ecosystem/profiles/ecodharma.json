These meditation retreats, study seminars and training camps are intended to help people to empower themselves to make changes in themselves and the world consistent with a life-affirming vision.\n\nWe seek to develop practices which honour the inseparability of the transformation of the self and the world; to support the shift from a destructive industrial growth society to a life-affirming future; to contribute to the creation of a movement of renewal and resistance; to evolve spiritual practice where courageous compassion and a deepening realisation of our radical interconnectedness helps us to live in solidarity with life.\n\nAlthough we live in a time of ecological and social crisis, a truly life-affirming, creative and sustainable future is possible. Such a future depends upon a radical transformation of both our values and consciousness, and the socio-economic forms that currently condition both the individual and our society. The goal of the eco-dharma project is to support such radical change, to transform insights and understandings into a lived reality – from the spiritual to the social, the political to the personal, and the imaginative to the inspirational!
