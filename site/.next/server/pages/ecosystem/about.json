We know that many of them are trying to create change, often by shifting how we make sense of the world, by how we engage with one another — in short, by engaging in sense-making and culture-making.\n\nBut that is more or less all we know about this newly emergent space, and, as such, it calls for exploration. What are its defining characteristics? How do organizations differ, and how are they similar? What *is* this space? What are the other ecosystems to which it is interconnected? And how will it evolve? These are some of the things we are hoping to find out.\n\nFinally, there is purpose beyond simply exploration: understanding can lead to self-awareness and self-understanding making the ecosystem more known, interconnected, resourced and effective.\n\n### What\n\nThis project seeks to map the emerging ecosystem around social change for a new paradigm. We're seeking to provide an overview of the organizations in the space and better understand what they focus on, by what means, and what ties them together. We hope from this we can start to give a more coherent shape, name and set of key terms to the space.\n\n### Why\n\nWe want to make the ecosystem visible to itself. We hope in doing this the actors in the space will better be able to connect and collaborate with one another, as well as situate themselves and their work in a broader context to inform their strategies and approaches.\n\nWe also hope that, by helping to create a more coherent identity for this ecosystem we can create a more united front when engaging with outside actors, boosting the credibility and effectiveness of our shared efforts.\n\n### How\n\nWe are undertaking research to gather information on organizations, communities and individuals that are potentially part of this ecosystem -- as well as the connection to nearby spaces. The first stage of the project involves the creation of a repository, outlining the types and areas of focus of these organizations. Over time we will conduct more in depth analysis to map the ecosystem and chart how actors relate to one another across a number of dimensions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nWe emphasize our work here is clearly preliminary and is limited by both our resources and knowledge.
