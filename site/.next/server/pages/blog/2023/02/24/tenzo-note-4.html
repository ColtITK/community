We can see the whole cycle of life through the fermentation process, particularly the evolutionary process coming from the death - life endless circularity and reconnect to what to be human deeply feels.” \n\n![[../../../../assets/images/tenzo-note-4-cooking.jpg]]\n\n  \nThe Miso retreat took place during three days focused on exploring the deconstruction process of being fermented by life. The food workshop was dedicated to exploring the posture of the cook and how to deal with the complex issues of our world by allowing them to be manifested in the kitchen or during meals through a disposition of receptivity to what is. \n\nDuring a moving debate participants could explore the complexity of our food system, building new capacities to talk about it and expand what food really means in a time of transition when good and bad are not clear anymore. \n\nOne of the main intentions of the workshop was to give an opportunity for cooks to share how they each could contribute to the current crisis, through their posture and capacity to share a different sense of nourishment. \n\nValerie concludes, “to deconstruct the sense of not having enough in the context of food insecurity can contribute to the peace we need in chaos and this is  what cooks can offer .\n\n![[../../../../assets/images/tenzo-note-4-cooking2.jpg]]\n\n## Next food residency\n\nThe context of metacrisis is urging us to pause. Cooks have a role to play that Valerie wants to share with, so if you are cooking for groups, communities or if you are interested to do so please join for the next food residency to practice how to cook in a manner that can help to ease fear of change. \n\n### June residency: How to nourish the world today?\n\nIn the same manner as the 2 previous editions, this residency would start by deepening the question internally with a 3 days retreat where we would practice O ryoki (the practice of being nourished by what is) and listen deeply to the heart of our world within the posture that erases the separation between  internal and external. \n\nThen we will explore the basic concepts and protocols that Valerie has received from zen tradition and actualised for non-monastic communities.\n\nAfter this, there will be 2 weeks to explore how we could cook our life to better nourish the world and have joy doing so  together. During this residency we will swim in the dordogne and paddle, explore plum village, and visit the worldly renowned prehistoric caves of the region, while also getting the necessary time to work. \n\nPotential dates TBC: June 11th - July 2nd \n\nValerie will organize this residency if a minimum of 7 people express their desire  for this Food Praxis teaching.
