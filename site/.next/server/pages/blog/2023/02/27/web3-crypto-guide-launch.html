That said, if you are in any way interested in Web3, the guide provides a useful perspective which is often missing from the mainstream crypto narrative.¬†\n\nWeb3 \u0026 crypto has become a massive phenomenon with bold claims made about its actual and potential impact. These claims go far beyond traditional technology boosterism (better, faster) to claims for radical transformation (and improvement) of our economic and social systems ‚Äì for example, Web3 is revolutionary for X where X is everything from [money](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/money) and the economy to governance to funding [public goods](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/public-goods-problem) like (open) software, carbon removal etc.\n\nAs you may know, Life Itself is all about creating a wiser, weller world and you might assume that crypto and Web3 would fit into our repertoire of tools like fingers in a glove. Yet, during our initial exploration we felt that the Web3 space lacked the rigorous sensemaking necessary to make an informed decision about whether the claims were legitimate.¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúAs someone who aligns closely with many of the more progressive aspirations of the Web3 space, I think it‚Äôs really important we have an honest, good faith conversation about whether these technologies are the best way of fulfilling them,‚Äù says Theo Cox, Head of Life Itself Labs.¬†\n\n‚ÄúToo often discussions fracture into tribalism, with mud slinging from both sides on the basis of affiliations and vested interests. I wanted to move past that, into a space of ‚Äúhey, we all want the same thing here. I may be more skeptical around Web3 as a way to achieve that, but here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the evidence and reasoning for my view so if you disagree, let‚Äôs talk‚Äù.\n\nThere was a gap in the collective knowledge surrounding Web3 and while there were many people critiquing its claims, no rigorous analysis had been made. So we did it!¬†\n\n‚ÄúTo my knowledge this is the most detailed and evidence-based breakdown of the key claims made about Web3 technology. I hope it can not only help people make sense of the underlying mechanics of what‚Äôs going on, but also spark a more productive conversation. I‚Äôd love nothing more than for this to lead to discussions with people who disagree which move us all closer to our shared aspirations,‚Äù says Theo.\n  \n## What does the guide contain?\n\nThe guide explores the social, economical and political aspects of Web3 and Crypto with a particular focus on making sense of key claims often touted by proponents of Web3.  \n\nBy steel-manning these key claims through conscious, critical and open-minded dialog with a diverse set of experts, the guide teases out the underlying hypotheses and assumptions and then engages in rigorous and constructive critique.¬†\n\nThe guide also explores the overall aspirations of the Web3 movement and examines how these might be achieved, whether through improvements to [blockchain](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/blockchain) based approaches or by other means.\n\nAll of this is neatly packaged into a stand-alone website from which the entire guide can be explored. It is split into three main sections: \n\n1.  Full analyses providing comprehensive and authoritative analyses of the biggest claims being made in the space. The following claims are analyzed:\n    \n\n-   [Bitcoin will (and should) become the new gold standard](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-bitcoin-will-and-should-become-the-new-gold-standard)\n    \n-   [Crypto will provide better payment and remittance services](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-will-provide-better-payment-and-remittance-services)\n    \n-   [Crypto can help solve the public goods problem](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-help-solve-the-public-goods-problem)\n    \n-   [Web3 can help revolutionize cooperation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-web3-can-help-revolutionize-cooperation)\n    \n-   [Crypto can provide better means of financializing non-financial value](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-provide-better-means-of-financializing-non-financial-value)\n    \n\n2.  Deep dive notes, which are detailed analysis notes from our deep dive conversations. These have not yet been formatted and expanded into full analyses ([You can help](https://web3.lifeitself.org/meta/editing)). We've undertaken deep dives on the following claims:\n    \n\n-   [Blockchain can (and should) be used to create ‚Äúnetworked states‚Äù to replace existing nation states](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-blockchain-can-and-should-be-used-to-create-networked-states-to-replace-existing-nation-states)\n    \n-   [Crypto can act as an anti-authoritarian force](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-act-as-an-anti-authoritarian-force)\n    \n-   [The crypto space is just an unfettered market, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-the-crypto-space-is-just-an-unfettered-market-and-theres-nothing-wrong-with-that)\n    \n-   [Crypto is just the latest evolution of fintech, and is leading us towards a better financial system](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-is-just-the-latest-evolution-of-fintech-and-is-leading-us-towards-a-better-financial-system)\n    \n-   [Crypto should remain outside of securities regulation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-should-remain-outside-of-securities-regulation)\n    \n\n3.  Finally, FAQs are brief responses to some common questions asked about crypto and Web3.
