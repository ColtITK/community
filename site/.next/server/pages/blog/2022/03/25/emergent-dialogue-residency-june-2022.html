There is a particular kind of freedom, the freedom of choice, which depends on individuation. This capacity of individuation unleashed a torrent of creativity—science, new technologies, new forms of art and music, and more. Individual geniuses unlocked the secrets of the universe, opened pathways of consciousness, and created ways to connect us across vast distances.\n\nAnd this process of individuation created ever-more radical forms of separation, from deeper dimensions of ourselves, from Nature, from each other. At this point, we have arrived at what could be called „hyper-individuation.“ Everyone asserts his or her relative truth: „You do your thing, and I do mine; You have your truth, and I have mine.”\n\nThis extreme individuation is leading us into crisis: nothing holds us together anymore, our societies are falling apart. At a personal level, we can’t integrate our self-sense in the wholeness of life. At a collective level, we are failing to work together on the urgent, critical issues facing us as a species, e.g. climate collapse. Moreover, the destruction of bioregions and disruption of the climate caused by human activity is a result of this separation. The complexity of what we are facing calls for more than individual genius.\n\nMoreover, we don’t want to (and can’t) “go back” to pre-individuated collective identities, whether pre-modern or pre-individuated indigeous cultures.\n\nWhere do we turn? Already, human beings are being moved to seek connection and connectedness beyond the separate self. Efforts to end the divisions of racism and sexism are part of this desire. The mindfulness revolution of the last forty years has been a powerful impulse to free the self from separation. And the craving for community, for co-working and co-living and co-creation, is growing stronger and finding new expression in remarkable social and organizational experiments. \n\nThe question is less and less „what about me?“ and increasingly „what about we?“ \n\nThis raises a host of further questions, such as: \n\n- Is there a way to develop beyond separation, where our self-sense and wholeness become integrated? Where we can “transcend and include” the dichotomy between individual and collective?\n- Are there specific practices to cultivate a “we-space,” a space beyond and between us and yet where we show up fully ourselves?\n- Is there a collective creativity in which the unique contribution of each individual is amplified and integrated into more complex and rich whole?\n\nThe answer, in a word, is _yes_. \n\nIf this intrigues you and you would like to experiment with a new potential that transcends and includes our individual creativity, you may now have the question: **How do I find out more about this? How do I learn and practice this?**\n\nWe are excited and honored to announce **a 7-day intensive workshop, followed by a 3-week residency, led by the global pioneers of emergent dialogue, [Thomas Steininger](https://oneworldindialogue.com/about/) and [Elizabeth Debold](https://oneworldindialogue.com/about/).
