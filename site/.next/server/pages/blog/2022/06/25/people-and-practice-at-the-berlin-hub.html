The opposite of that doesn't leave space for shared practices and structures - everyone's life is its own universe with it's own rhythms, obligations and priorities - separation from each other is often the unfortunate result.\n\nAt the Berlin Hub we face the difficult challenge of trying to bring these two worlds together.
