Whether it is through the neutral cereal, the alternation of flavors and textures, the silence in the kitchen or at the table, our ability to deal with it without further injunction, it is the subject of the encounter with the living authorized by the place discovered. Of course, the encounter with the ingredients that we touch, that we wash, but also with the others, all the others, all the things that our eyes meet and that come to life because they are looked at. \n\nWe left enthusiastically and with the joy of having found our place again, the joy in the kitchen of having nothing else to do but to be the activator of the elements, in a framework that is both efficient and creative, and in this posture, the joy of being able to sit in the world in a more serene way. \n\nAfter these 10 days, too short for all, I could see how much unnecessary stress, tension and responsibility had been lifted from the shoulders of the participants and how the joy of cooking for others had been transformed into something much more peaceful. \n\nThe abandonment, the joy of doing, the effortless movement, the right intention is the whole practice of the community cook and this is what manifested itself during our time together . \n\nDeep gratitude.\n\nValerie D.H Duvauchelle\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var r=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var f=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var m=(n,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(n,e)=\u003e{for(var i in e)r(n,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},a=(n,e,i,h)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let o of f(e))!g.call(n,o)\u0026\u0026o!==i\u0026\u0026r(n,o,{get:()=\u003ee[o],enumerable:!(h=u(e,o))||h.enumerable});return n};var y=(n,e,i)=\u003e(i=n!=null?c(p(n)):{},a(e||!n||!n.__esModule?r(i,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):i,n)),b=n=\u003ea(r({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var l=m((I,s)=\u003e{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};w(k,{default:()=\u003ej,frontmatter:()=\u003ev});var t=y(l()),v={title:\"Reclaiming Spaciousness: Reflections On The Conscious Food Workshop\",created:new Date(16534368e5),authors:[\"valerie\"]};function d(n){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",img:\"img\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\"},n.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"From April 25th to May 4th, the Life Itself Bergerac hub was host to the 'Nourriture D\\u2019Eveil' residency, an integrated conscious food workshop, facilitated by \",(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://en.lacuisinedelabienveillance.org/les-messagers\",children:\"Val\\xE9rie Duvauchelle\"}),\".
