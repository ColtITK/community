Our first guests arrived with their children ranging from teenagers to just born, grandparents were there too – all three generations were gathered reflecting on our past, present and future. A sense of familiarity was in the room with a mix of international visitors and local neighbors.

She described how she had walked a fine line, balancing between hope and despair. It was then followed by my performance.\n\nAs I approached the audience some were looking intently and other looking away. I knelt down to a child and asked:“What do you see that the future is made of?” he answered: “Nothing”. Of all the answers I received to my questions this was the one that struck me the most: for, in reality, our future is indeed made of “nothing” – it is unwritten, it is open. But we tend always to project onto it our opinions, our fears, our hopes which all come from our past experiences. However, only when we get present to the fact that the future is made of nothing can we be present to the fact that we create that future together from what we stand for. What we think, what we say, what we do, creates who we are and will become. \n\n![](/assets/images/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-13.23.29-1024x567.png)\n\nSylvie performing \"Prophecy\", Picture by Max Pugh.\n\nFinally, we were treated to an extraordinary and immersive live musical performance by Laetitia Donoma and Matthieu Le Brun.

Two nights later I had a dream. One of my ancestors came to visit: my father-in-law who died a few years ago. He had always been there next to me, but by honoring him I gave him enough strength to come visit me, could feel his love so present, he was very happy.\n\nSo who do you need to honor, and what do you need to let go, so the future may be with nothing and so we can start to create anything?\n\nHere are a few more pictures of the day:\n\n![](/assets/images/IMG_8965-683x1024.jpg)\n\nPicture by Max Pugh\n\n![](/assets/images/IMG_8945-1-1024x683.jpg)\n\nPicture by Max Pugh\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var d=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(n,e)=>{for(var a in e)o(n,a,{get:e[a],enumerable:!0})},s=(n,e,a,i)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let r of m(e))!p.call(n,r)&&r!==a&&o(n,r,{get:()=>e[r],enumerable:!(i=u(e,r))||i.enumerable});return n};var y=(n,e,a)=>(a=n!=null?d(g(n)):{},s(e||!n||!n.__esModule?o(a,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):a,n)),b=n=>s(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var c=f((I,h)=>{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var j={};w(j,{default:()=>P,frontmatter:()=>x});var t=y(c()),x={title:'After the Art & Eco-spirituality event: What will the future be made of? \"Nothing\"',created:new Date(16620768e5),categories:[\"art\",\"events\"],authors:[\"sylvieshiweibarbier\"]};function l(n){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",img:\"img\"},n.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"A wall of golden engraving rises up, already from a distance announcing the mystical importance of its message.
