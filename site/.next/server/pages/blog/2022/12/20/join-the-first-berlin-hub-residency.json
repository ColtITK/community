With all the amenities, such as Hasenheide park (a lush, tree-filled expanse of green), Tempelhofer Feld (an airfield converted to public playground), a beautiful cemetery behind the buiding, swans on the canal, weekly markets, public transport only 2 minutes away, and much much more around the corner, this is the ideal area for anybody excited to dive into a city bustling with energy, history, and heartfelt people.\n\n- ![](/assets/images/herbst-1024x1024.jpeg)\n    \n- ![](/assets/images/cemetery-1024x768.jpeg)\n    \n- ![](/assets/images/Hasenheide-1024x768.jpeg)\n    \n- ![](/assets/images/Kanal-1024x768.jpeg)\n    \n- ![](/assets/images/rainbow-1024x768.jpeg)\n    \n- ![](/assets/images/sen.jpeg)\n    \n\nThe Hub consists of four apartments each with their own bathroom, kitchen, and flair. Complemented with a large common space and training dojo, it houses up to 11 residents. The apartments are spread out in a larger building complex, providing a unique set-up compared to many other communities.\n\n![](/assets/images/Shopfront1.jpeg)\n\n# The Residency\n\n## **Guiding purpose:** \n\nWe aim to be a nourishing and inspiring home of friends and collaborators supporting each other in connecting to ourselves, each other, the wider world and what lies beyond (call it the mysterious, god or the sublime). \n\nFrom this connection, we grow our capacity to make tangible, impactful actions toward a regenerative culture in and beyond Berlin that works for all life. \n\nWe offer space, bring people together, and strive to live in a way that cultivates care, joy, stays with the trouble, and seeks wisdom continuously as we grow collective action out of connection to what’s in and around us. \n\n![](/assets/images/klimastreik.jpeg)\n\nUnfuck the system please - and move it towards regeneration!\n\n### **We guide ourselves by (but are not limited to) underlying frameworks such as:** \n\n- Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD)\n- Theory U\n- Art of Hosting Practices\n- Regeneration Frameworks such as e.g. Daniel Christian Wahls “Designing regenerative Cultures”\n- Zen Buddhism\n- Internal Family Systems\n- Nonviolent Communication\n- Theater of the Oppressed\n\n## Who are the hosts?\n\nThe residency is hosted by Ilja Maiber and Sen Zhan, who've been living at the Berlin Hub for the last 2 1/2 years. Beyond their own efforts they'll be inviting residents into stewarding roles to co-create a resilient, self-governing system.\n\n![](/assets/images/ilja.jpeg)\n\nIn his role as Hubmanager Ilja made sure that the structures of the hub support its inhabitants - gathering what felt like decades of learning in the process. Coming from studies in Rhetorics and Sociology he later dove into a transformative MSc in Strategic Sustainable Development (MSLS), which opened many doors: To hosting, narrative practices, co-creation, community building, participatory design and much in between and beyond. He dedicates himself in particular to the challenge of bringing together what is often separated: Be it the rational and the emotional, creation and reflection, planning and intuition, the physical and the mental.\n\n![](/assets/images/sen-2.jpeg)\n\nSen is lifelong community builder who loves fanning the sparks of creative expression in others. She is an occupational therapist by training, a storyteller by trade, and serial immigrant driven to support inner and outer healing through the transformative power of telling one's own story. As the founder of the Beyond Asian community, Sen's lived experiences as a Third Culture Asian immigrant inform her perspectives on social justice, diversity, and inclusion. She strives to bring embodiment to collective storytelling through mediums from podcasting to Theatre of the Oppressed.

Our understanding is that none of us is complete in our development, so we invite you to respond as honestly as you can about both your celebrations and challenges.\n\n**Can I come for a time period other than 3 or 6 months, or start my residency on a date other than Feb 1 or May 1?**\n\nHaving made the experience that every new person impacts the existing social fabric we strive towards clear entry points. If the idea of the residency really speaks to you, but these entry points just don't work for you - please indicate it in your application, or reach out via email (****theberlinhub@gmail.com****)! Together we'll see how we can go about the situation.\n\n**Can I leave the residency early?**\n\nEventhough we'd like you to stay the full duration of the residency (i.e. 3 or 6 months), we acknowledge that sometimes life is unpredictable. We invite you to indicate in your application if a full stay is not possible, so we can figure out together how to integrate this.\n\n**What are the arrival and departure dates and times?**\n\nWe suggest Feb 1, 2023 and May 1, 2023 as the arrival dates for each of the residenies, respectively, to give space\n\n**Will there be time for my personal work and projects?**\n\nIt is only during the Connection week that we ask everyone to make themselves available for the full schedule, barring major outside commitments (which we ask you to communicate as a part of your application). The remaining time of the residency will combine some daily shared practices with a largely open schedule to support personal work and projects. So there will be time for self-work and commitments like work and studies. A key aspect of the residency is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.\n\n**Do I have to attend all of the daily and weekly practices?**\n\nThe daily and weekly practices are considered essential aspects of co-creating a connected and regenerative culture. The general understanding is that everyone agrees to participate consistently in these practices, but if there is an occasional schedule conflict with an outside commitment, we simply ask that people communicate with us in advance. We ask that people reflect on their desire to commit to these shared practices before applying to attend. \n\n**What is the process for requesting financial assistance?**\n\nOur aim is that cost is not an obstacle to anyone’s participation. If you are experiencing financial constraints, please send us an email at ****theberlinhub@gmail.com**** describing: 1) your current financial situation; and 2) the specific amount of support you are requesting. We will do our best to see if we can provide assistance in some way or another.\n\n**What happens when I am on the waiting list?**\n\nIf all the places are booked, you are welcome to submit an application to be on the waiting list. We will review your application and invite you to an interview if/when a spot becomes available. Note that this could even happen at the last moment if someone cancels unexpectedly.\n\n**I don't think residency is for me right now** **or** ****my candidacy might not be selected**** - **but I would love to be a part of this project**! **How can I still take part?**\n\nFor those in Berlin, we offer an extended community Membership for those who want participate in practices, workshops, and events. Stay tuned for more!\n\n## Contact us\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us at **theberlinhub@gmail.com** if you have other questions that have not been addressed above, or in the resident application form. We look forward to receiving your application!\n\n### Acknowledgements and gratitude\n\nThis outline has in parts been inspired by the efforts of the facilitation and hosting team of the Life Itself Embodying Collective Transformation residency.
