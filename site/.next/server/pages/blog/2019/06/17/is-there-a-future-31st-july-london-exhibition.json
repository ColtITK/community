The programme sees diverse and thought-provoking responses to the question and includes members of the Birthstrike movement, Jess Gaitán Johannesson & Adam Ley-Lange presenting a personal and ongoing process of decision-making; French - Taiwanese performance artist Sylvie Shiwei Barbier exploring her pregnant body and the celebration of a new life, and a piece by filmmaker and documentarian Cécile Embleton exploring the impact of climate change on public health, fertility and increase in miscarriage. See full programme below for more details.\n\nThis is an artist-led event organised and curated by Cécile Embleton from **Art Earth Tech** in collaboration with Dyana Gravina from Procreate Project.\n\nInternational artists have been invited to examine the two fold theme of parenthood and the ecological crisis and what arises from discovering just how intimately intertwined these themes are. The works will explore; the joy, love and hope that is born in our necessity to create new life - on both a personal and collective level - grieving for a sense of mothering that we have lost in our relationship to nature and in our societies, and the urgent ecological challenges we face in order to create a viable future for our children.\n\n[Book your ticket now >](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/is-there-a-future-performance-and-illustration-art-on-reproduction-the-ecological-crisis-and-our-tickets-63756605724)\n\n## Artists\n\nSelected international artists have been invited to examine the two fold theme of parenthood and the ecological crisis and what arises from discovering just how intimately intertwined these themes are.
