He currently works as a community manager in a different kind of community, providing him with interesting comparisons between approaches to community building along his journey here.  \n\nA few words from him: _â€œBeing around people from different backgrounds and cultures has been central in my life.

I come from a large family and have tried community living for a short period but never anything permanent. So far itâ€™s been really great to connect with other Hubbies and guests that visit as well. Itâ€™s also been nice to have a community of people that have become both friends and sources of perspective and wisdom.

He is a proper local, born and raised in Berlin. He loves music and currently works in an online mental health project.\n\n  \nA few words from him:\"_States of deep connectedness with others (\"We-ness\") is what makes life valueable to me.

We chose \"being with my myself & being with others\" as the theme for November and explored it in many ways.\n\nNovember and the beginnings of December then held many things: A pop-up restaurant, a dinner with the Moos community, Vertels send-off to a long vacation in the U.S., Christmas lights and a new exciting partnership on the horizon!\n\nStay tuned!
