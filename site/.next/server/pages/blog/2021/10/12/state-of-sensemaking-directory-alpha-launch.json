We know that many of them are trying to create change, often by shifting how we make sense of the world, by how we engage with one another — in short, by engaging in sensemaking and culturemaking.\n\nBut that is more or less all we know about this newly emergent space, and, as such, it calls for exploration. What are its defining characteristics? How do organisations differ, and how are they similar? What _is_ this space? What are the other ecosystems to which it is interconnected? And how will it evolve? These are some of the things we are hoping to find out.\n\nFinally, there is purpose beyond simply exploration: understanding can lead to self-awareness and self-understanding making the ecosystem more known, interconnected, resourced and effective.\n\n### Emerging commonalities\n\nThe site is a tool for exploring an emerging ecosystem whose nature, boundaries and name are not yet fully defined. Nevertheless some key features are visible: a focus on systems, emergence, sensemaking, integral, culture-making and metamodernism as buzzwords, along with activism, governance, and regenerative culture. It is characterised by a strong lean towards spirituality (mindfulness) and the relationship between inner and outer life.\n\nAt a higher level, we have identified three core thematic areas which tie together the varied groups in the space: _collectivism, (w)holism and counterculturalism and culture-making._\n\nBeyond this thematic overlap we have identified four major areas of activity: _physical spaces, research, media/publishing and events_. Nonetheless, it has been notable that many organisations have shifted to multi-channel working across a number of these (e.g. producing media content as well as running retreats and events).\n\n[READ MORE at ecosystem.lifeitself.org](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/)\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var d=Object.create;var s=Object.defineProperty;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var f=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var u=(t,e)=>()=>(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(t,e)=>{for(var i in e)s(t,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},o=(t,e,i,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of m(e))!p.call(t,a)&&a!==i&&s(t,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(r=g(e,a))||r.enumerable});return t};var y=(t,e,i)=>(i=t!=null?d(f(t)):{},o(e||!t||!t.__esModule?s(i,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):i,t)),v=t=>o(s({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var h=u((z,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var H={};w(H,{default:()=>x,frontmatter:()=>b});var n=y(h()),b={title:\"State of Sensemaking Ecosystem Mapping Directory - Alpha Launch\",created:new Date(16339968e5),categories:[\"ecosystem-mapping\"],tags:[\"culturemaking\",\"sensemaking\"],authors:[\"rufuspollock\"],image:\"/assets/images/state-of-sensemaking-home-launch-20211012-1.png\"};function c(t){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",strong:\"strong\",img:\"img\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",h3:\"h3\",em:\"em\"},t.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:`We're excited to announce the alpha version of our ecosystem mapping directory entitled the \"State of Sensemaking\":`}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/\"})})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"The site is one output from our \",(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://lifeitself.org/ecosystem/\",children:\"ongoing efforts to map an emerging ecosystem\"}),\".
