Their names are Carmen, Naresh, Liam, Hannah, Charley, Theo, Valerie and even Rufus came by! Some stayed for a few days, some for a week, some for a month, some left and came back. Among other things they helped host a Contemplative Activism Workshop, the Emerge Fringe events, a Warm Data Lab and participated in or even hosted our Community Practices.

Theo summarized and illustrated the experience beautifully in [this](https://lifeitself.org/2021/10/19/reflections-on-the-2021-emerge-gathering/) post. We offered a place to practice:\n\n![](/assets/images/grafik.png)\n\nCome and be in practice with us\n\nOne of the beautiful things about hosting events like these is how they allow to connect to people beyond the actual event. Some of the people we met also joined for other gatherings, for example an impromptu Poetry Slam:\n\n![](/assets/images/poetry-slam.jpeg)\n\n## Systems Change, not Climate Change!\n\nBefore the people of Germany elected a new government back around the end of September there was a big climate strike in many cities, among them: Berlin! Of course we went to support, saw Greta, and many many people. It's bittersweet to look back at it now, after the disappointing results of COP26 - nevertheless it felt good to be out there and contribute to the energy that is the (youth) climate movement\n\n![](/assets/images/klimastreik.jpeg)\n\nUnfuck the System!\n\nFollowing this trail, Lauren went on her own adventure a few weeks later: Hosting a session on youth alimate anxiety during COP26 she travelled to Glasgow, visited Charley in the UK and is currently in Bergerac, reunited with many of the friends who travelled there from Berlin\n\n## Octobers Theme: Flow\n\n![](/assets/images/poi-4-1024x768.jpeg)\n\nVertel teaching us how to Poi\n\nOctober was not only about emergence, but as every month we also chose a theme. This time: Flow! As one of our new members, Vertel, enjoys doing flow arts, he hosted a session where we used a combination of socks and flour to create pois, which we then spun in all kinds of ways. You never know what Community Practice might hold for you :)\n\n## November: A new theme and new hubbies\n\nSo here we are: November. While Lauren is away we found a person to stay in her room: Ludwig, who you'll get to know next time, as well as Lucia, a new member for the ground floor.
