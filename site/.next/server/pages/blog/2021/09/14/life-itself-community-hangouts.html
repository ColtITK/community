In recent years we’ve noticed a gathering of energy within the field of social change. What once felt like small ripples within the ocean are beginning to feel more and more like waves of potential. This is an incredibly energising and exciting time! At the same time, we know from experience this endeavour can also be tiring, and, at times, lonely.\n\nLife Itself is also now 5+ years old and hundreds of people have participated in one way or another. Yet until now there has been no real way to catch up and stay in touch in real-time.\n\nThat’s why we are organizing **_Online Community Hangouts_**. A place for reflection, connection and, most importantly, no pressure to perform.\n\nWhilst at the core we are offering a space to slow down and have fun, we anticipate that through the interconnection of great people from around the world sharing their ideas, experiences, and hopes for the future we may just see the blossoming of nourishing relationships.\n\nCreating connections between like-minded people is incredibly important to us; we think Carl Jung said it best when he shared _“One thing I have found difficult in my life is being able to see and understand something that those around me don’t. I feel a strong desire to discuss topics of such depth and yet feel a deep loneliness in the absence of being able to talk about what feels truly meaningful.”_\n\nSo if you’re looking to meet people who have immersed themselves within topics such as sensemaking, meta-thinking, shadow work, systems change and much more then come and drop in. **Our next session is Sunday 3rd October, 2021** **at 5pm UK/6pm CET.**\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var d=Object.create;var i=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(t,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(t,e)=\u003e{for(var o in e)i(t,o,{get:e[o],enumerable:!0})},s=(t,e,o,r)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of m(e))!p.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026a!==o\u0026\u0026i(t,a,{get:()=\u003ee[a],enumerable:!(r=u(e,a))||r.enumerable});return t};var y=(t,e,o)=\u003e(o=t!=null?d(g(t)):{},s(e||!t||!t.__esModule?i(o,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):o,t)),b=t=\u003es(i({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var l=w((I,h)=\u003e{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var j={};f(j,{default:()=\u003ek,frontmatter:()=\u003ev});var n=y(l()),v={title:\"Community Hangout - Oct 2021\",created:new Date(16315776e5),categories:[\"community\",\"hangouts\"],tags:[\"community\",\"wellbeing\"],authors:[\"charley-lee\"]};function c(t){let e=Object.assign({ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",strong:\"strong\",p:\"p\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",em:\"em\"},t.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(e.ul,{children:[`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"What\"}),\": Informal community hangout.
