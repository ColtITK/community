She had a thoughtful discussion regarding learning to grow beyond motherhood, and spoke about Life Itself as an organisation more broadly.\n\nOn May 5th, Sylvie appeared as part of a [Wise Societies talk](https://www.joelightfoot.org/thelightfootpodcast/episode/2bb22d66/18-sylvie-barbier-on-life-itself-and-learning-to-grow-beyond-mothering), hosted by Demos Helsinki. The inimitable Geoff Mulgan presented his recent paper on new ways to think about Wisdom, and Sylvie took part in the discussion. She highlighted the importance of sitting with the trouble, and it was great to see her help spread the ideas of Life Itself to a wider audience. \n\nOne of the big projects for Life Itself is the ongoing renovation of our site at Petit-Bois Martin in Bergerac, France.

After another week of work, we’ll be ready to start construction. \n\nThe eventual aim is to split the property into 3 apartments over 2 floors. The idea is that those units will be able to be reconfigured into different sizes and spaces.
