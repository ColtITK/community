One (actually by now two) of them was regarding clear rules to deal with the pandemic. This gave us clarity how we can best protect each other, make the hub a safe space, and do our part when it comes to lowering the numbers in the bigger scheme of things. \n\n**Christmas time**\n\n![](/assets/images/christmas-679x1024.jpg)\n\nIt's seems so long ago by now (especially in Hub time): Christmas time was full of warm hearts and good food.\n\n**Kitchen time**\n\n![](/assets/images/Kuche-1024x245.png)\n\nAll prerequisites for food are in now.

Check! Pictures and harvests? You bet!\n\nWe've created a special place for everything we want to capture and make accessible. It's called The Digital Hub and it grows steadily. A recent example: After a meta-conversation where we reflected on the weekly Community practice, its purpose and how we can get even more out of it, we decided to move from two community breakfasts to breakfast + dinner, add a sign-up sheet, and also add a place where we put our Personal Practices (for easier connecting around them).\n\nNo idea what we're talking about?

It’s been super exciting to get to know the diverse and caring community and to explore new way of co-living and co-being, together.

So intentional, caring and open. In the long run I want to learn more about facilitation, co-living, meditation and so much more but for the moment I am just really happy, that I get to spend my time with these people.

People brought in their proposals and after few short rounds of discussion we voted on how to go forward with them - can we fully step into it yet or does it need more development? Are people excited for it? Who will be in the drivers seat and what support do they need?
