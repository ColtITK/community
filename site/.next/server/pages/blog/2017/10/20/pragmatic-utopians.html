We can renew our visions, believe again, and do so without the arrogance of certainty, but sustained by open-minded faith.\n\n_Epilogue: to reflect this reclamation of a positive utopianism perhaps we should rename it: from utopia to eutopia – from “no place” to a “well place”._\n\n![Hope for a better future - sharosh-rajasekher-T7s_TnKO-dk-unsplash](/assets/images/sharosh-rajasekher-T7s_TnKO-dk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg)\n\n_Image Credit: Sharosh Rajasekher Unsplash_\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var u=Object.create;var n=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var c=Object.getPrototypeOf,f=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(t,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),b=(t,e)=\u003e{for(var o in e)n(t,o,{get:e[o],enumerable:!0})},r=(t,e,o,s)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let i of d(e))!f.call(t,i)\u0026\u0026i!==o\u0026\u0026n(t,i,{get:()=\u003ee[i],enumerable:!(s=m(e,i))||s.enumerable});return t};var y=(t,e,o)=\u003e(o=t!=null?u(c(t)):{},r(e||!t||!t.__esModule?n(o,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):o,t)),w=t=\u003er(n({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var p=g((I,l)=\u003e{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var v={};b(v,{default:()=\u003ej,frontmatter:()=\u003ex});var a=y(p()),x={title:\"Pragmatic Utopians\",created:new Date(15084576e5),categories:[\"our-philosophy\"],tags:[\"pragmatism\",\"utopianism\"],authors:[\"rufuspollock\"],image:\"/assets/images/sharosh-rajasekher-T7s_TnKO-dk-unsplash-1.jpg\"};function h(t){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",em:\"em\",img:\"img\"},t.components);return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"I like to describe myself as a pragmatic utopian \\u2013 and Life Itself as an exercise in pragmatic utopianism.
