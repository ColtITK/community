It also restricts future innovation which must build upon existing research,” says Dr Rufus Pollock, co-founder of Art / Earth / Tech and founder of Open Knowledge. Pollock, who leads the project, explains that “today we’re caught in a dilemma: either we grant patent monopolies that deny millions access to life-saving medicines or we harm future innovation by reducing prices and profits for drug companies. This needn’t be the case; it’s a false dilemma. With iMED, we hope to show that there are viable alternatives to monopoly rights that don’t pit incentives for innovation against access to medicine. We can have both.”\n\n“Improving health outcomes at the individual and collective level is a complex challenge requiring innovative strategies and solutions to ensure access for all, including the poor and vulnerable,” says Saadia Madsbjerg, managing director of The Rockefeller Foundation. “The Rockefeller Foundation believes strongly in advancing health for all people, and we are excited to support the iMED project in its work to explore more inclusive models for financing medical innovation.”\n\nAs part of the project, the team will produce a series of white papers and communications materials to engage relevant stakeholders. In addition to this, they will host a high-level event in 2018 to bring these stakeholders together.\n\nIf you would like to know more, the project’s website is found here: [http://imedproject.org](http://imedproject.org/).  \nIf you want to contact the team, they can be reached at imed@artearthtech.com\n\n## About Art / Earth / Tech\n\nArt / Earth / Tech seeks to offer a new way of living and understanding modern life that allows participation in contemporary society while pursuing wiser and weller ways of living.
