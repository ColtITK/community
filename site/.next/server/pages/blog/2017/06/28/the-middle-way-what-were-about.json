The gathering reflects this.\n\nA middle way between the start-up and the monastery. A path that incorporates the best qualities of each whilst discarding their excesses.\n\nWe combine the purpose and engagement of the “start-up” life with the mindful living and reflective peace of the monastery. From the start-up we leave behind the stress, anxiety, the prioritizing of success over joy, from the monastery we leave behind the retreat from the world, the disengagement from practical matters.\n\nPut simply, we are a community combining mindful reflection with pragmatic purpose.\n\nIn our experience, this is rare. Deep mindful practice often ends up as a retreat from conventional life. We become other-wordly and unengaged with “reality” and practical issues. We end up in a monastery or in some kind of new-age hippie-dom. On the other side, are those deeply engaged in the everyday world – activists, researchers or entrepreneurs. In this mode, we become all too this worldly, disengaged from a deeper reality. We struggle to maintain any balance between thought, spirit and body usually finding ourselves consumed by our thoughts whether buried in a computer screen absorbed by our ideas. Lack of a deep mindful practice ultimately results in inner and outer conflict. Consumed by our work we become burnt out, angry, cynical and ineffective.\n\nWe believe true, lasting change – transformation – requires us to combine the best of both worlds. Outer transformation – of our communities, our economies and our societies – is impossible without inner transformation. And inner transformation disengaged from purpose and engagement with the world can simply become escape and detachment – an endless retreat.\n\nWe’ve seen this ourselves. Commitment undistinguished from attachment creates burn-out and cynicism. We sacrifice means to ends. We accept unwell, unbalanced lives for the sake of achievement and success: be it an activist burning out to fight climate change, or the startup CEO sacrificing family and friends to sixteen hour workdays. Ultimately, means and ends can not be separated this way: unwell means make unwell ends.\n\nWe believe there is an alternative and we are busy trying to create it. We know we have a lot to learn, and plenty of mistakes to make. But we can promise the journey will be extraordinary.\n\nCome join us.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var r=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(n,e)=>{for(var a in e)r(n,a,{get:e[a],enumerable:!0})},o=(n,e,a,s)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let i of u(e))!g.call(n,i)&&i!==a&&r(n,i,{get:()=>e[i],enumerable:!(s=m(e,i))||s.enumerable});return n};var y=(n,e,a)=>(a=n!=null?c(p(n)):{},o(e||!n||!n.__esModule?r(a,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):a,n)),b=n=>o(r({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var h=f((_,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};w(k,{default:()=>W,frontmatter:()=>v});var t=y(h()),v={title:\"The Middle Way: What We're About\",created:new Date(1498608e6),categories:[\"our-philosophy\"],tags:[\"life-itself\",\"middle-way\"],authors:[\"rufuspollock\"]};function d(n){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",em:\"em\",img:\"img\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\"},n.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"Art Earth Tech\\u2019s Gathering is taking place from 22 - 29 July 2017, and this week Institute member Rufus Pollock gives a synopsis of what we are about and how The Gathering reflects this.\"})}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/man_walking.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/two_streets.jpg\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"the-middle-way-what-were-about\",children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#the-middle-way-what-were-about\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"The Middle Way: What We\\u2019re About\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We provide a middle way.
