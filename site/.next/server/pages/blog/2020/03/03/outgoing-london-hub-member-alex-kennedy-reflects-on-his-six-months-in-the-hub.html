A grounding in wisdom and knowledge.\n\nThe potential displayed in front of us through the capability of **technology**. The impacts it can bring to our society and our lives if we’re able to harness its power in bringing new possibilities.\n\nAnd the significance in **art**. Defining our cultural compass through all its mediums on every scale. The importance as a societal mouthpiece to create the narratives we need to see and hear.\n\nI have begun to break down these concepts into symbols and areas in the hope of also framing my own work in similar ways so I can draw others as I have been drawn to Art/Earth/Tech. (example of this pictured below)\n\nI read [Rufus’s book](https://openrevolution.net/) when I first moved into the hub. It really helped me to understand the framing on how our world is constructed, based off old rules unsuitable for the progression we know today. Its legal structures, its approach to ownership and how an almost lazy placement of this into a profoundly new landscape has become the root of so many issues we face today surrounding technology.\n\nA huge swath of what we know has only ever been added to from what came before. Even the keyboard I write this with has been designed based on the needs of a mechanic typewriter to avoid parts clashing together.\n\nDesign can evolve gradually. But full system regeneration is hard. Cultural change is hard. Habits, die hard.\n\nBut we need to transition beyond anything thats come before. Use nature as our guide. We need to frame the problem in completely new ways and break down every obstacle that stands in its way.\n\nWe need new visions for our future. Or we won’t have one to pass on.\n\nWe need to use the potential we have. Squandered currently in a thousand areas by a false story we’re told about how things should be.\n\nOur ancestors are watching.

Condensing complex solutions down into bitesized visual and emotional forms that tell a story of the ideal. Each part backed by further breakdowns, examples, showcases, experiments, data and knowledge. Added to by the crowd behind that idea to bring shared wisdom to its roots. A compelling vision with a plan to bring it into existence. If we can align a large group of people in a way that allows wide scale collaboration around a project then our world of possibilities open up.\n\nHow can we create our economies to align us in these ways? What does ownership look like? Currency? Law? How can technology facilitate wide-scale trust? How can we return to our nature? Live better with each-other. In a way that allows us all to fulfil our potential through support and understanding.\n\nThese are the questions I aim to answer. I believe the solutions lie in the trends we already see. In coworking, in freelancing, in the creative fields, in film, in our side hussles, in our games and culture. In coliving, our relationships and our search for meaning and community in a structure that degrades these things.\n\nI believe how we store, own, trust and share is about to undergo a shift and my hope is to shine the light for that path ahead.\n\nBeing involved with the gathering of minds at art/earth/tech I have met fascinating people from a variety of backgrounds that all share in some common underlying direction.
