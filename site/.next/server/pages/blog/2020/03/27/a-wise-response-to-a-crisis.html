Recently, Coronavirus has changed everything and so this issue has a blend of our own offerings and material with a selection of writing and events that inspire us. \n\n# Our response to the Coronavirus \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cXfEetnQa8\u0026feature=youtu.be\n\nThis one minute film Danger, Opportunity, Meaning and Hope distils our thoughts for our call on Saturday - created by member Richard Millington   \n_\\- and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmBq3VO9w_MLTKD_CHsYN-Q/featured?view_as=public) for more videos of our salons and events_\n\nThe Chinese word for crisis is composed of the word “Danger” and “Opportunity”. Right now, there is a lot of the conversation in the public space coming from a place of  “fear” and focused on the danger and disruption. Here, at Art/ Earth / Tech we would like to emphasize more the “opportunity” – without in any way diminishing or denying the suffering arising for people – but focusing more on the lessons and reflection that we may take from it?  \n  \nLet’s dare to dream together and paint a new world, one where we trust and learn from the lessons the Coronavirus has to offer, come join us in our open **Online Community day this [Saturday evening 28th March 6-8pm (CET),  5-7pm (UK)](https://zoom.us/j/659327540)**  \nJoin via Zoom here [https://zoom.us/j/659327540](https://zoom.us/j/659327540)\n\nContinue reading our post here: [The opportunities and lessons to take away from Coronavirus](https://artearthtech.com/2020/03/23/the-opportunities-and-lessons-to-take-away-from-coronavirus/)\n\n# Essay: Outbreak \n\n### by Charlotte du Cann\n\nCharlotte du Cann is a writer, editor and co-director of the [Dark Mountain Project](https://dark-mountain.net/). She is involved in our Contemplative Activism Sangha and recently spoke at the Human // Nature // Stories event held in London by member Hannah Close. You can watch her talk, [The Kist,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jHD3r0wy0) which she mentions in the essay below.  \n\n_\"Having resisted every warning and admonishment to transform and change our ways, we are now, as a collective, being forced into a cocoon ourselves, to do the work we should have done generations ago...I am bereft of access to places and people I once loved. But I know this loss is part of the payback, the great sobriety, what Bendell has termed the second R of Relinquishment, ‘what we need to let go of that is making the crisis worse’.\"_\n\nTo continue reading this moving piece, read on the [Dark Mountain Project website](https://dark-mountain.net/outbreak/?fbclid=IwAR1Tf5lgbkhgJnOzEyOZL8j0Uu2PJ0UFgLUes21TYSdSq82cnZ_lPUoztbA)\n\n![](/assets/images/sophie-40-bm-683x1024-1-1.jpg)\n\n_The Oil Slick at the recent action against BP sponsorship at the British Museum Photo: Guy Reece_\n\n# Blog: Letting go of being enlightened\n\n### by Liam Kavanagh\n\n\"Is now the time when we start to truly realise that when we declared our enlightenment a few centuries ago, we were a bit premature and to make a course correction?\n\nI don’t know, but I feel certain that our decision making is impaired by massive attachments to these notions: that we can control fate through reason and science, that we are separate individuals living “our own lives”, and dogmatic ideals of equality. In the paper, I discuss how these ideas relate to our inaction in the face of the long-standing threat of climate change.\"  \nHere, Liam discusses how they have affected our coronavirus response. [https://artearthtech.com/2020/03/25/letting-go-of-being-enlightened/](https://artearthtech.com/2020/03/25/letting-go-of-being-enlightened/)\n\n# Practice\n\nWe need our practice more than ever, particularly in the confines of our homes with our loved ones! These regular group meditations are excellent. \n\n### Love Vs Virus\n\n[Twice daily meditations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrNHCgKDm7TGu8Hp6AiqW4A) from Burgs, The Art of Meditation, at 9am and 6:30pm CET; 10am and 7:30pm UK time.These live group loving kindness meditations and talks offer support, encouragement and advice on how to build a positive response to the unfolding situation we are facing. \n\n### Cup of calm\n\nDaily 15 minute meditations before work at 8:45am from the She Leads Change group [https://sheleadschange.org/events/cupofcalm/](https://sheleadschange.org/events/cupofcalm/)\n\n# Book(s)\n\n**[Die Wise](https://orphanwisdom.com/die-wise/): [A Manifesto for Sanity and Soul](https://orphanwisdom.com/shop/die-wise/) by Stephen Jenkins**, a palliative nurse in Canada and founder of Orphan Wisdom. Stephen describes our uncomfortable relationship to dying through real experiences he has had at the bedside of dying patients, the conversations with their family members and listening to the same fear of death. I refer to this book all the time and it really transformed my relationship to living and dying, and how we humans frame it. From the minute we are born, we are dying. He puts dying in the centre and through his many conversations with the dying, and their loved ones, our greatest fear is being forgotten. That we cling on to life to stay a part of something, to stay important, the last hurrah of our ego. \n\nAs we sit in the pandemic with panic and death edging towards our front doors, we will be called to embrace our relationship with dying and with grief.   \nStephen has written a blog about coronavirus too:   \n_“Leaving the wishing, the hoping, out of it. That’s how you leave the panic out: By leaving the hope out, too. By being a citizen – not an inmate – of a troubled time_. “[Window](https://orphanwisdom.com/window/)\"\n\n### Our wise booklist \n\nWith the time we have now, you can finally make a start on your ‘aspirational’ bookshelf, which if you are like me is full of the books I should read and haven’t made the time too. This [Wise booklist](https://artearthtech.com/2019/12/10/wise-booklist/) from our community is a good start, indeed I’m not sure many are left off!\n\n# Online events\n\nThese days, we are gathering online instead of in person.
