The LEAP chose Taiwan because it is a country where “factory style” education has been pushed to the extreme: Standardized testing and rote memorization are at the center of an education system where children work long hours at school and go to cram schools until late at night (eg. 10⁄11 PM).\n\nFor more info see the [SCQH developed by Life Itself on the situation in Taiwan](https://artearthtech.com/2017/11/16/transforming-taiwan-education-with-a-leap/).\n\nThe Taiwanese government has started to move away from “factory style” implementing important curricular reforms. Yet, developing these take more than just a new policy – it will take a new educational culture. Without an evolution in culture, policy innovations will fail as teachers will remain stuck in the old mentality and applying their old tools. Yet, a new culture takes deep practice and experience. To contribute to this new culture and mentality shift, the LEAP hosts “anti-cram summer programs” where schools become a place where students are not driven by external standards or pushed to produce the “correct” behaviour and instead become a space for students to be heard, expressed and driven by what is within them.\n\n![](/assets/images/leap-sea.jpg)\n\n## Colophon\n\n- Start: Sep 2017 (first Summer Camp in July 2018)\n- End: Ongoing\n- Status: Active\n- Who: the LEAP was (co-)founded by two Life Itself members Ninon Godefroy and Sylvie Barbier and is led by Ninon Godefroy.\n- Impact: Over 100 students have participated in LEAP programs.\n- Life Itself role: Life Itself provided early inspiration, consulting and incubation for the The Life Expression and Aspiration Project (The LEAP).\n- Links: [https://www.theleap-tw.com](https://www.theleap-tw.com/)\n    - Youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ihNjlHnvnBksGe0xD-JGA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ihNjlHnvnBksGe0xD-JGA)\n    - Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/leap\\_tw/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/leap_tw/?hl=en)\n    - Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/leaptaiwan/](https://www.facebook.com/leaptaiwan/)\n- Manifesto (Mandarin version):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V\\_-uhjJEo4w\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var w=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(n,e)=>()=>(e||n((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),g=(n,e)=>{for(var i in e)o(n,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},l=(n,e,i,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of u(e))!m.call(n,a)&&a!==i&&o(n,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(r=p(e,a))||r.enumerable});return n};var y=(n,e,i)=>(i=n!=null?c(w(n)):{},l(e||!n||!n.__esModule?o(i,\"default\",{value:n,enumerable:!0}):i,n)),v=n=>l(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),n);var h=f((j,s)=>{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};g(k,{default:()=>x,frontmatter:()=>b});var t=y(h()),b={title:\"Leap\",created:new Date(15844896e5),categories:[\"life-itself\"],tags:[\"leap\"],authors:[\"rufuspollock\"]};function d(n){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",img:\"img\",h1:\"h1\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",div:\"div\",iframe:\"iframe\"},n.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The LEAP is the Life Expression and Aspiration Project \\u2013 and a new model for education in Taiwan.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"In its structure, the LEAP is living experiment to develop and advocate for pedagogical techniques and an educational system that is wiser and weller.
