This involves treating others more equally than the next person does. This is an obvious contradiction woven into Western moral life. Being less egotistical is one helpful way of relieving the resulting tension, but in this talk I suggest a complementary, though taboo, route.\n\nWe can recognise that ideals of equality offer an amazingly effective moral 'rule of thumb' often pointing the way to desirable outcomes, but have, unhealthily, become enshrined as _the truth_, taboo to even question. They have also become a very unsatisfactory substitute for compassion and love, which in more 'spiritual' times were the center of moral life.\n\nHowever much ideals of equality have done for us, they are still only an ideal, an intellectualisation. No ideal can guide us cleanly through all moral decisions (can smokers and non-smokers have equal rights on a train car?) No ideal gives us the ability to actually live up to those actions they do guide us towards (such as sharing our wealth). Ideals are also a basis for psychological violence. Relationship psychologists have long said tell us that non-verbal contempt is the greatest predictor of relationship dysfunction, perhaps the turbulence in our social compact could have been anticipated long ago from this basis.
