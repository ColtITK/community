This is a practice we have tested ourselves internally for several years and it works. Which is why we want to offer it to our broader community. Here are some additional things that will get covered:\n\n- Self motivation and self management\n- Accountability\n- Validation exercise\n- Integrity\n\n> _\"I always take so much out of it! For me especially it is reassuring to see that we all struggle with similar things and that that, too, is part of the process.
