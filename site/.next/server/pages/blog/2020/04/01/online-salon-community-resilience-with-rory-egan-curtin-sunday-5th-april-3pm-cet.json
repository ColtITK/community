The research I will present at Life Itself asks why these changes are occurring, and what will likely be the consequences for the culture and ecology of this unique agrarian region. **What makes this discussion of particular interest to sociologists, urban planners, and systems thinkers alike, is systems theory has yet to identify the level of interdependent complexity and collaboration at play in traditionally agricultural and collaborative communities**. This is significant because the collaborative culture of such farming societies may present a more resilient approach to how communities can work with one another and their environment, fostering more cohesion rather than competition, and ensuring greater food security and social cohesion. Inspiration for a better future?\n\n**Bio:** \n\nRory Curtin is a doctoral student at Humboldt University in Berlin, who graduated from Columbia University with her MA in Tibetan Studies. Her research focuses on the macro-significance of findings that can illustrate the benefits of cooperation specific to agrarian societies. As, she recognizes the potential to incentivize governments to encourage community-based agriculture through subsidies, not only for the benefit of preserving aspects of traditional culture, but serve to protect the resilience of fragile ecosystems. She currently lives in Berlin. \n\nYou are welcome to drop in just for a part or join for the whole session. \n\n[MORE INFO](https://lifeitself.org/2020/05/18/sunday-salons/)\n\n[BOOK](https://ti.to/art-earth-tech/online-calls)\n\n**\\## Background**\n\nThe Life Itself Salons ☕are friendly, informal discussion sessions.
