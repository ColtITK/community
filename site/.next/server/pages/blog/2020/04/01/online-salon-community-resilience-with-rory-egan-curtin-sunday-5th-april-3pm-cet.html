This is significant because the collaborative culture of such farming societies may present a more resilient approach to how communities can work with one another and their environment, fostering more cohesion rather than competition, and ensuring greater food security and social cohesion.

Her research focuses on the macro-significance of findings that can illustrate the benefits of cooperation specific to agrarian societies. As, she recognizes the potential to incentivize governments to encourage community-based agriculture through subsidies, not only for the benefit of preserving aspects of traditional culture, but serve to protect the resilience of fragile ecosystems.
