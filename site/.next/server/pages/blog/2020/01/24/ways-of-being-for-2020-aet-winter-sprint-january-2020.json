Real Estate Fund! New London members! Recruiting Petronella!; what was mediocre (Meh…) and what didn’t work (Bleurgh).\n\nWith 2019 put to bed, we were clear to create what we wanted for 2020.

Finding people: passing on the culture so we can form a community to live wisely\n\n2\\. Develop the hubs: submitting the plans for our next rural hub in Bergerac and finding new members (as above) and core manager for the Berlin Hub.\n\n3\\. Generating money so we can expand our work and our reach to more people through receiving grants, establishing the Real Estate Fund and creating new revenue streams and enterprises\n\n4\\. Refine our brand so that at a glance people have a direct intuitive feeling of what we are about and why we do what we do\n\n5\\. High profile outreach so that we raise our credibility and spread our vision to attract like minded people (see no.1)\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-02-02-aet-focus-2020.JPG)\n\nWhoop whoop ?? - there is a lot to get involved this year, from attending the Contemplative Activism events, moving into our spaces in Berlin and La Cheraille, running events at our hub in Berlin, to helping renovate and design our space in Bergerac! Crucially, we are on the hunt for a wicked Hub Manager for our building in Kreuzberg, Berlin - if you know someone who gets what Art Earth Tech is up to, has a practical sense of managing spaces, and speaks German of course, then please send them our way ?? ?? ??\n\nOver the Sprint fell our second Community Day where new members Hannah Close and Richard Millington joined us for a day of sharing our plans and dreams for 2020; we sat with the question, “What are we up to **_really_**?\n\n—> Awakening. Being before doing and having; “being in life itself,” as Liam puts it. And a stand for life itself. We referred to [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)) that offers for transcendence as a need on condition that other needs are met first. However, [Max-Neef’s fundamental human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef's_Fundamental_human_needs) encompasses more without such a hierarchy.

I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live, I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me, it is a sort of splendid torch which I’ve got a hold of for a moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var r=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var p=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(i,e)=>()=>(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(i,e)=>{for(var t in e)r(i,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},s=(i,e,t,a)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let o of g(e))!m.call(i,o)&&o!==t&&r(i,o,{get:()=>e[o],enumerable:!(a=u(e,o))||a.enumerable});return i};var b=(i,e,t)=>(t=i!=null?c(p(i)):{},s(e||!i||!i.__esModule?r(t,\"default\",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):t,i)),y=i=>s(r({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),i);var d=w((_,h)=>{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var x={};f(x,{default:()=>B,frontmatter:()=>v});var n=b(d()),v={title:\"Ways of Being: AET Winter Sprint January 2020\",created:new Date(1579824e6),categories:[\"life-itself\",\"our-philosophy\"],tags:[\"being\",\"wisdom\"],authors:[\"artearthtech\"]};function l(i){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",img:\"img\",strong:\"strong\",div:\"div\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",em:\"em\",a:\"a\"},i.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"To kick off the year, we came together in frosty foggy January to review 2019 and plan this coming year 2020.\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We started with a half day of embodiment work to reconnect ourselves including drawing our faces on the window pane Picasso style and meditations.
