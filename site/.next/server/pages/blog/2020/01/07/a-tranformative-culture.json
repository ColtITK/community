Which is not bad or good, you’re never going to do all the things you said you were going to do. And we get that! This may seem obvious and too simple to need a blog on, but actually to have the trust and space within a team to open up what’s behind your inertia, discomfort or loss of integrity, is highly valuable for our organisation.\n\nWe are a remote team too, working in Bristol, London, outside Paris and sometimes Berlin. Therefore, instilling a culture we all honour and practice is crucial as habits, distractions and other projects can quickly take us off track and our communication, and essentially our love, can get sluggish. Recently, I got stuck in what I call my ‘sludge’. Where I would have inspiring, optimistic and regenerative calls with my colleagues and then a few days later I would be back into feeling the drudge of pushing up hill - a common sense from activists pushing against the tide of cultural norms and expectations. The penny dropped as to why we, Art Earth Tech, exist: for people like me! If you lived in a community of people whom you could call on for a quick call to get something off your chest and transform your being in that context, imagine how free and energised we would all be to get done what really needs to get done. We would be clear to focus on what’s important, rather than being held back by our thoughts, feelings, stories…! This liberated me, and gave me fire to make this possible and now I want to make this available for many.
