You will be heard by the others in the group who will also share what they are discovering about themselves. Outside of the call, you will be set writing each week that will become your autobiography. Take the time for yourself to look at your life to date so you are free to create the life you want.\n\nYou will be part of a WhatsApp group where you get to share weekly insights and pictures of your autobiographical work. In community is a way to help us break free from the narrative of separation into a sense of belonging. You can benefit from our practices regardless of your age from 20 to 80’s and beyond, our community welcomes people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\n> _Doing this with others, the sharing was so moving and I got present to how I belong to one big family, that no matter the age or where we come from or our social background - we are all the same._\n\nIf you have any queries, please do contact petronella@lifeitself.org\n\n### What do I get out of these calls?\n\nThese calls allow you to have a better understanding of your life path, create balance and a clearer direction to go forward in your life. To live in the present moment by using powerful creative tools such as collage, writing and group sharing. To be part of a community.\n\nHere are some things that will get covered: \n\n- \\[Coll\\]ages: We will work with collages on the narratives we created about ourselves and the world at different ages, so we may bring more awareness on the dynamics at play in our life\n- \\[I\\]dentity: we will explore how our sense of “I” was formed\n- \\[Auto\\]biography: we will bring more consciousness into our life journey rather than living from our subconscious mechanism \n\n> _The collages were powerful as a creative process to free myself from the past._\n\n[book](https://ti.to/art-earth-tech/online-calls)\n\n### Why Art Earth Tech value the practice\n\nPart of creating a wiser world we all want to live in, is by becoming more aware of how we form our identity and narratives, so we may master the perspective we have on the world, ourselves and others. We see that having deep understanding helps being empowered, and sharing that with others is where you can transform your story.\n\n**Join our 'Write your autobiography' calls, every Wednesday at 6:30pm-7:30pm UK for 2 months (9 sessions) with your hosts Sylvie Barbier & Petronella Tyson**\n\n**Sylvie** is a performance artist, the co-founder and head of programs at Art / Earth / Tech.
