To be listened to, to listen to others and receive their 'good medicine' through their shares. These circles are held where people feel safe to openly share what is going on for them: it may be an insight you had this week, a breakthrough, a part of your story.\n\n**What:** A small circle of people where you get to share what brought you here. You'll have 5 minutes to share uninterrupted and without judgment whilst the circle listens. If you request coaching, people can arrange that off the call.\n\n**Why:** We often presume that it is difficult to connect with new people.

You will be invited to share “what brought you to where you are now”, uninterrupted by questions. These will be hosted by trained facilitator Petronella Tyson.\n\n### **What do I get out of these circles?**\n\nYou get to know and discover parts of yourself, but more than that you get to be heard by a group of people and have that sense of connection with people on a weekly basis. You will also learn and practice communication skills in listening, sharing, and being authentic for other people.\n\nAfter eight years working in distributed teams, living away from friends and family, I have found ways to bridge vulnerability, connection and shared joy. Sharing our stories and reflections are what helps us connect and grow.

Stories are at the heart of how we understand ourselves, each other, and connect as a community. \n\nCome and find out for yourself.\n\n**Petronella** is a trained facilitator, community practitioner and Doula. She has twelve years experience working in communities and is passionate that they are the place for transformation and wellbeing.
