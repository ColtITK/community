We hold one another to account for what we say we will get done that day; and what was done the day before. We give our word to the team, and that is all we can give. There is no one else telling us what to do, no ‘pressure’ we create from elsewhere, it is on our word to create our work and move the company forward. That is powerful. As it is in everyday life. \n\nAnd if you don’t do what you said you would… there is nothing wrong. If you can identify what ‘blocked you’, what got in your way and how we as a team can help (both with coaching and structurally), we go through it during the call. You can only get the support though if you share what stopped you - and that requires a level of openness and vulnerability crucial to team and to community bonding. \n\nEach morning now, I sit and watch as 24 people from across Europe pop up on my screen because they gave their word to show up to the group, and to themselves; to hold one another to account, the sense of integrity and commitment is tangible and their results show that. \n\nThe next cohort starts on 8th June at 8:30am (BST) and is open to book [here.](https://artearthtech.com/2020/04/29/getting-s-done-online-calls-2/)\n\nCreativity is like a muscle, the more you practice the stronger it gets. In our **[Creative Practice](https://artearthtech.com/2020/04/02/morning-creative-practice/)** calls, you get to be more in tune with yourself and your intuition. Our community provides support and helps you with motivation, since one of the hardest things is to keep yourself motivated in your creative practice when you are alone. Morning is the best time to activate your right brain, so you will continue your day being more in the flow. Join Sylvie at 7:30am (BST) every Thursday morning from 11th June for six weeks and see for yourself what happens if you practice!

This is a beautiful journey with a group to reflect and discover perhaps long forgotten years of your life, key events and key people who took you in a different direction. During our weekly call you will get to share and reflect on your own life path, how your identity got formed and start to transform the seeds of the past.
