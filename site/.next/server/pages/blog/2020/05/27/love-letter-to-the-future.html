You are soil, air, water and fire; skin, breath, blood — life. You are beauty. Do you see the beauty around you?   \nWhat can you see around you, right now? Where can you find beauty? In the trees, the sky, the city scape. All is earth, air, water, fire. All is a part of you and you a part of it. One beautiful whole with all the people in their rooms, on the streets, in the grass, climbing trees. You are each alive and sharing this time and the human condition — your hearts all beating at the same time.   \nNow, do you look inwards and see beauty? Never forget how beautiful you are. Your skin, your blood, your soul — all is beauty. Live beautifully. Love. Love inwardly and outwardly.   \nI am with you always. Your mother and father are a part of you, always. The past future, the past present — all roads lead to the same place: now.   \nNow is when I write this letter to you, my beautiful grandchild. Now is you reading these words like the whispers of a ghost. Like all ghosts whispering, there is a longing to be heard. We all just want to be seen and to be heard. Who sees you? Who hears you?   \nNever shrink. Never make yourself small. You are an expression of life and of beauty. You have a birth right to express yourself and to be seen and to be heard.   \nSpend your time with those who make you feel alive, who see you, who hear you, who tell you: _you’re beautiful_.   \nNever stop seeing the beauty in things and that which is sacred in the every day.  \nAll my love,  \nYour Grandma XXX\n\n![](/assets/images/liane-metzler-b32qg6ua34y-unsplash.jpg)\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var d=Object.create;var n=Object.defineProperty;var y=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var c=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var m=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var b=(a,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(a,e)=\u003e{for(var r in e)n(a,r,{get:e[r],enumerable:!0})},s=(a,e,r,i)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let o of c(e))!g.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026o!==r\u0026\u0026n(a,o,{get:()=\u003ee[o],enumerable:!(i=y(e,o))||i.enumerable});return a};var p=(a,e,r)=\u003e(r=a!=null?d(m(a)):{},s(e||!a||!a.__esModule?n(r,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):r,a)),w=a=\u003es(n({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var h=b((L,l)=\u003e{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var j={};f(j,{default:()=\u003ex,frontmatter:()=\u003ev});var t=p(h()),v={title:\"Love Letter to the future\",created:new Date(15905376e5),categories:[\"our-philosophy\"],tags:[\"future\",\"loveletter\"],authors:[\"sylvieshiweibarbier\"]};function u(a){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",strong:\"strong\",a:\"a\",br:\"br\",img:\"img\",em:\"em\"},a.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:'In our last Creative Practice Call we wrote a \"Love letter to the future\" dedicated to our grand children.
