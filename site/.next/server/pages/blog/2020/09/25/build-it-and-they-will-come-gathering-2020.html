This emergence of our true human compassionate nature comes from a frame, a « space » which can only exist in the mirror of a trustful community.  Being seen and seeing others with no judgement nourishes our joy of living and reactivates our natural compassion towards other members and outside.  Then, from that, we deeply generate an intuition of acting wisely in the world.”_\n\nWatch this space for the development of our collective frame and accompanying practices. \n\nWhat a safe harbour to find out of lockdown with extraordinary people to share it with and plot the future for Life Itself. Thank you.\n\n\u003e _“The Gathering provided me with ways of interacting and bonding with others that I’d never encountered before.
