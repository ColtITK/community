In a drop-in, drop-out format, the space is held by a group over time, with the idea that people can join for any amount of time (e.g two days or even two hours is fine) but that a space/consciousness is held by and transmitted between a shifting group (as it tends to be “naturally”.) There will be time and space for private work on personal projects but co-location means we can share free time. This is done in an everything-is-optional and free way.\n\nThe venue is in an urban area, but is situated within a large public park, which is uncrowded, and beautiful -- with woods and entrancing natural rock formations.

The project’s objective is to be a resource that supports different ways of working (together) and makes new imaginings possible. With this in mind, please send a brief mail to: [enquiries@bidstonobservatory.org](mailto:enquiries@bidstonobservatory.org), giving us an idea about your practice, or what you might be working on during your stay here. Just a few quick sentences will do! Read more about the observatory at: [http://www.bidstonobservatory.org/](http://www.bidstonobservatory.org/)\n\n### **A little more about contemplative activism:**\n\nMany people come to a realisation that our environmental crisis is part of a much deeper crisis, which has to do with our alienation from the source of our deepest intelligence and wisdom. This includes many famous writers and spiritual leaders like Joanna Macy, Martin Heidegger, and Thich Nhat Hanh, but also many normal people who just can't shake the impression that something really big is missing from life. Our deepest contemplative (or spiritual, or mystical) intelligence and our disconnection from it are something that we experience in a deeply subjective way. We know something is missing from life when we are outside of it, even though it seems like our society encourages this. We cannot point directly to this intelligence, or to its absence, so when one of us comes strongly into contact with this intelligence, they tend to think they have seen something very new and unlike what other people are talking about. So we have invented many  words and phrases like being \"embodied\", \"present\". \"aware\", \"mindful\", \"connected\",  we experience \"suchness\", \"thusness\", \"tatata\" and \"non-duality.\"  These are all pretty much the same thing. More words for the same thing won't make more people understand these words mean. They must see it directly themselves to know what the words refer to, and this is the hardest thing to accept. We can't tell people \"just do it\" and expect results.\n\nSo what do we do? The good news is that many, many people have been responding to this lack. It is afterall, the lack of perhaps the most important thing in life. Practices such as mindfulness and other meditation, shamanism, reconnection, many strands of visual and performance, body work, plant medicines, many forms of trauma therapy, intellectual movements such as phenomenology, work on embodiment, and on hemispheric differences in the brain all may be seen as responses and gestures towards ways of widening awareness of our situation. But these movements are still just beginning to become more than the sum of their parts. They are not aware of themselves as working for the same thing. Part of what we are hoping to do is collectively raise awareness of our pursuits' intertwinedness, but also to co-create a space for these related pursuits to make each other more whole and more effective. Also though, there is the question of resisting confinement of these concerns to the private \"non-political\" sphere, resisting the idea that these conversations belong in a \"non-secular\" ghetto while in the public sphere, we continue to pretend that the only things that are real and important are those that we can see and touch. Politics shapes the public consciousness, like it or not. Apolitical wholeness is an oxymoron.\n\nContemplative activism also means embracing the need for planning and organisation, while not being a slave to accomplishments and goals. Teaching meditation or doing art requires some planning. Using concepts is not a sin, nor is technical knowledge. It is just that the analytical mind is a spectacular servant and a bad master. We will never be effective in putting things right by denying ourselves use of this power.\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var d=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var u=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(i,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),v=(i,e)=\u003e{for(var n in e)o(i,n,{get:e[n],enumerable:!0})},s=(i,e,n,r)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of p(e))!g.call(i,a)\u0026\u0026a!==n\u0026\u0026o(i,a,{get:()=\u003ee[a],enumerable:!(r=m(e,a))||r.enumerable});return i};var f=(i,e,n)=\u003e(n=i!=null?d(u(i)):{},s(e||!i||!i.__esModule?o(n,\"default\",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):n,i)),b=i=\u003es(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),i);var l=w((M,h)=\u003e{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var x={};v(x,{default:()=\u003eT,frontmatter:()=\u003ey});var t=f(l()),y={title:\"Contemplative Activism Event\",created:new Date(15821568e5),authors:[\"liamkavanagh\"]};function c(i){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",strong:\"strong\",em:\"em\",img:\"img\",a:\"a\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",hr:\"hr\",h3:\"h3\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\"},i.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We are hosting our second event of Art Earth Tech's contemplative activism initiative \\u2013 held in a \\u201Cdrop-in, drop-out\\u201D format, located at Bidston Observatory (a lovely space for artistic exploration outside Liverpool) from March 14th through to March 29th.
