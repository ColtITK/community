He holds a PhD in Statistical Physics from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris, where he studied Complex Systems Physics and Philosophy of Science. Fascinated by the emergence of higher-order simplicity out of complex interactions, he specialized in network science applied to biological, medical and social contexts at the Barabasi Lab in Boston, before becoming a research fellow at the Learning Planet Institute (formerly Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity, CRI) of Université Paris Cité. He is also a co-founder of the Just One Giant Lab NGO that supports the development of emergent, large-scale open research communities through social and digital technologies. Passionate about music and spontaneous jamming, he explores how group rituals and facilitation mechanisms help achieve collective flow states, with a focus on multi-modal, dialogical embodied practices to experience philosophical and contemplative concepts such as emergence, inter-being, or at-onement.
