These include: to embody authenticity and empathy, hold multiple perspectives, make collaborative decisions, mediate conflict and polarization, navigate complexity, and take empowered action.\n\nTo build the capacity to do so in a meaningful and lasting way does not simply involve reading a book, watching a video, or attending one workshop. We believe people are best supported by being immersed in a community of practice – by being surrounded by others on a shared path.\n\n### **About the residencies**\n\nEach month’s residency will open with a week-long intensive training on core practices to cultivate inner well-being and thriving interdependent relationships and communities. It is both a setup for the residency’s self-practice and demonstrator of the practices we are seeking to explore. The week-long training may also be booked as a stand-alone workshop.\n\n![three people meditating in sunny room](/assets/images/IMG_4924_1-scaled-e1653601439702-1024x827.jpg)\n\n### **What we will explore**\n\nIntegrating both traditional wisdom traditions and leading-edge methodologies for human development, the practices and perspectives we will explore include:\n\n- Deepening Self-Compassion & Self-Empowerment\n- Nonviolent Communication\n- Internal Family Systems\n- Reinventing Organizations & Integral Design\n- Meditation & Mindfulness \n- Creative Expression, Movement & Play\n- Microsolidarity\n- Clarifying Life Purpose & Vision\n- Conflict Mediation & Restorative Justice\n- Consciously Engaging Power & Privilege\n- Collaborative Decision-Making\n- Compassionate & Whole-System Social Change\n- Sustainable Community & Ecovillage Design\n\n### **Integrating structure and flexibility**\n\nFollowing each month’s training week, we’ll dive deeper as a micro-collective, building up rhythms and patterns to support our embodiment of collective transformation. The remainder of each month will combine a container of core shared practices with a largely open schedule to support personal work and projects. The aim is to offer a structure sufficiently strong to hold us as a community, and sufficiently flexible to integrate our individualism. \n\n### Schedule\n\n**Training week**\n\n- 7:15-7:45am Physical Movement\n- 7:45-8:15am Meditation\n- 8:15 - 9:00am Self-Organized Breakfast & Clean-up\n- 9:00 - 10:00am Collective Home Care\\*\n- 10:00 - 12:30pm Morning Session\n- 1:00 - 2:00pm Lunch\n- 2:00 - 2:30pm Lunch Clean-up\n- 2:30 - 5:00pm Afternoon Session\n- 5:30 - 6:30 Collective Home Care\\*\n- 6:30 - 7:30pm Dinner\n- 7:30 - 8:00pm Dinner Clean-up\n- 8:00 - 9:30pm Evening Session\n\n\\* Choose one Collective Home Care slot per day\n\n![a man and a woman serve food onto plates](/assets/images/IMG_5059-scaled-e1653602699309-1024x836.jpg)\n\n**Rest of the month**\n\n_Daily practices_\n\n- 7:15-7:45am Physical Movement\n- 7:45-8:15am Meditation\n- 9:00-10:00am or 5:30-6:30pm (your choice) Collective Home Care\n- 6:30pm: Community Dinner\n\n_Weekly practices_\n\n- Wednesdays 7:45-9:30pm: Community Meeting & Heartspace\n- Saturdays 10:00am-12:00pm: Community Learning/Service\n\nThroughout the remaining time in these 3 weeks, we will construct an agenda collectively.

It could be a workshop, shared movement or physical exercise, or even a game, an excursion or a film screening.

More on Nadine at [www. embracing-life.com](https://www.embracing-life.com/).\n\n![portrait of jocelyn ames](/assets/images/Jocelyn-portrait.png)\n\n**Jocelyn Ames** is a community catalyst with over 10 years of experience embodying a toolkit of practices for personal and collective transformation. Her inquiry into making the world a better place for all was seeded by her schooling at the United World College of Southeast Asia. After completing a BA in International Development and Geography at the School of Oriental and African Studies (London, 2012) she went on to explore more grassroots and systemic approaches to collective change and sustainability. She has dedicated many years to living and experimenting in various forms of community around the world while tending to the inner ecology of the self, the interpersonal ecology of relationship, and regenerative relationships to the earth through yoga, permaculture, Nonviolent Communication, mediation, Internal Family Systems and menstrual cycle awareness. Since 2020, she has been working alongside Karl as host and developer of the Cultural Catalyst Network, as well as being a ‘social fabric weaver’ within the Microsolidarity network. You can read more about Jocelyn at [www.becomingtogether.net](http://www.becomingtogether.net/).\n\n![portrait of catherine tran](/assets/images/Catherine-portrait.png)\n\n**Catherine** **Tran** studied English at the University of Cambridge (UK) before completing a joint M.A. in Cultural Narratives at the University of Guelph (Canada), University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), and University of Perpignan (France) in 2021. During her master’s she explored the role that art and literature might play in cultivating ecological responsibility, and she's currently interested in what it means to be a responsible human being in a web of interspecies interdependence. This has led her to working for Life Itself, an organization of pragmatic utopians committed to action for a radically wiser, weller world. She participated in the Cultivating Conscious Community residency facilitated by Karl at the Life Itself Hub in January 2022, which inspired her to commit to embodying collective transformation.\n\n[Apply Now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHaD4-ISnoCj3qgeMOr-f-D0CD6hiHC4wnb70b7qUy8A-mJg/viewform)\n\n* * *\n\n## Testimonials\n\n![](/assets/images/4-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/2-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/1-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/3-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/4-1024x1024.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/2-1024x1024.png)\n\n_The ultimate goal in life is… to become the truest expression of ourselves, to live into authentic selfhood, to honor our birthright gifts and callings, and be of service to humanity and our world._Frederic LalouxAPPLY NOW\n\n![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is free-to-use-sounds-XtQNZRTIMYc-unsplash-1024x684.jpeg](/assets/images/free-to-use-sounds-XtQNZRTIMYc-unsplash-1024x684.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\n## FAQs\n\n**_What are you looking for in the application?_**\n\nIn the application process, we are most interested in how we can acknowledge and reflect both on how we all shine, and how we all struggle. Our understanding is that none of us is complete in our development, so we invite you to respond as honestly as you can about both your celebrations and challenges.\n\nAs we wish for you to express yourself in this application in a way that is as natural as possible, if you would rather respond to some or all of these questions using a video recording or some other means of communication, please feel free. That said, written responses are very welcome.\n\nWe realize there are a number of deeper reflection questions, so we invite you to aim for less than 250 words (or 2 minutes speaking) for each response.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\n\n_**Is there any reading or self-study I can do to prepare for the residency?**_\n\nYes, we ask that you go through at least the Core Resources of the [Recommended Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1sNWaVpFUTNVrzsKhcrv2lelmDLk6OoK841pcGGGyjjQ/edit).\n\n_**Can I come for part of the month?**_\n\nYes, as long as you attend the first week training, you can apply to come for less than the entire month, though we prioritize those able to spend the whole month.\n\n_**Can I join more than one residency?**_\n\nYes! You are welcome to join 1, 2 or all 3 residencies.\n\n**_What are the arrival and departure dates and times?_**\n\nArrival days for each of the Training Weeks respectively are 2nd September, 1st October and 1st November. You are welcome to arrive any time on those days to get settled in. We will kick off all together with dinner at 18:30, followed by a short Welcome and Orientation circle.\n\nDeparture days for each Residency are the 30th of each month. We kindly ask you to vacate your room by noon so we can prepare it for the next person, unless you are staying on for the next Residency. If you wish to stay longer, please get in touch by emailing catherine@lifeitself.org or karl@lifeitself.org to check for possibilities.\n\n_**Will there be time for my personal work and projects?**_\n\nIt is only during the training week that we ask everyone to make themselves available for the full schedule, barring major outside commitments (which we ask you to communicate as a part of your application). The remaining three weeks of the residency combine some daily shared practices with a largely open schedule to support personal work and projects. So there will be time for self-work then. A key aspect of the residency is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.\n\n_**Do I have to attend all of the daily and weekly practices?**_\n\nThe daily and weekly practices listed above are considered essential aspects of Embodied Collective Transformation. The general understanding is that everyone agrees to participate consistently in these practices, but if there is an occasional schedule conflict with an outside commitment, we simply ask that people communicate with us in advance. We ask that people reflect on their desire to commit to these shared practices before applying to attend. \n\n_**Why have regular daily and weekly shared practices?**_\n\nPut simply, meaningful change requires consistent practice. Any kind of deep or lasting change – whether to cultivate compassion and equanimity, to become a master facilitator, or to help build a movement to address climate change – requires developing new patterns of being and doing. Extensive research into human development indicates that cultivating desired habits, and letting go of habits we don't want, is most effectively supported by consistent, incremental practice. In other words, a journey of a thousand miles doesn't just begin with one step; it also involves taking many small doable steps, day after day, consistently and over the long term.\n\nFurthermore, consistent practice is tremendously supported by sharing our practice with others. Having dedicated companions – as we meditate, or cook, or strategize about a project – helps motivate us, keeps us accountable to our intentions, and supports us to experience a deep sense of belonging in community. Sometimes we may choose to do a practice in silence or with an internal focus, but knowing that others are with us transforms our practice profoundly, and helps us learn invaluable lessons about interdependence and how to build new cultural patterns.\n\n**_What is the process for requesting financial assistance?_**\n\nOur aim is that cost is not an obstacle to anyone’s participation. If you are experiencing financial constraints, please send us an email at info@culturalcatalystnetwork.org describing: 1) your current financial situation; and 2) the specific amount of support you are requesting. We will do our best to see if we can provide assistance in some way or another.\n\n**_What_** **_happens when I apply to be on the waiting list?_**\n\nIf a Training or Residency is fully booked, you are welcome to submit an application to be on a waiting list. We will review your application and invite you to an interview if/when a spot becomes available. Note that this could even happen at the last moment if someone cancels unexpectedly.\n\n[Apply Now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHaD4-ISnoCj3qgeMOr-f-D0CD6hiHC4wnb70b7qUy8A-mJg/viewform)\n\n## Contact us\n\nPlease don't hesitate to email karl@lifeitself.org or catherine@lifeitself.org if you have any questions.

She participated in the Cultivating Conscious Community residency facilitated by Karl at the Life Itself Hub in January 2022, which inspired her to commit to embodying collective transformation.\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHaD4-ISnoCj3qgeMOr-f-D0CD6hiHC4wnb70b7qUy8A-mJg/viewform\",children:\"Apply Now\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.hr,{}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"testimonials\",children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#testimonials\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Testimonials\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/4-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/2-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/1-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/3-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/4-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/2-1024x1024.png\",alt:\"\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"_The ultimate goal in life is\\u2026 to become the truest expression of ourselves, to live into authentic selfhood, to honor our birthright gifts and callings, and be of service to humanity and our world._Frederic LalouxAPPLY NOW\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.img,{src:\"/assets/images/free-to-use-sounds-XtQNZRTIMYc-unsplash-1024x684.jpeg\",alt:\"This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is free-to-use-sounds-XtQNZRTIMYc-unsplash-1024x684.jpeg\"})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.hr,{}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"faqs\",children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#faqs\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"FAQs\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.strong,{children:(0,n.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"What are you looking for in the application?\"})})}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"In the application process, we are most interested in how we can acknowledge and reflect both on how we all shine, and how we all struggle.
