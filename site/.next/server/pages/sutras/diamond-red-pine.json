After begging for food in the city and eating his meal of rice, he returned from his daily round in the afternoon, put his robe and bowl away, washed his feet, and sat down on the appointed seat. After crossing his legs and adjusting his body, he turned his awareness to what was before him.\n\nA number of bhikshus then came up to where the Bhagavan was sitting. After touching their heads to his feet, they walked around him to the right three times and sat down to one side.\n\n## Chapter Two\n\nOn this occasion, the venerable Subhuti was also present in the assembly. Rising from his seat, he uncovered one shoulder and touched his right knee to the ground. Pressing his palms together and bowing to the Buddha, he said: “It is rare, Bhagavan, most rare, indeed, Sugata, how the Tathagata, the Arhan, the Fully-Enlightened One blesses fearless bodhisattvas with the best of blessings. And it is rare, Bhagavan, how the Tathagata, the Arhan, the Fully-Enlightened One entrusts fearless bodhisattvas with the greatest of trusts.\n\n\"Even so, Bhagavan, if a noble son or daughter should set forth on the bodhisattva path, how should they stand, how should they walk, and how should they control their thoughts?\"\n\nThe Buddha told the venerable Subhuti, “Well said, Subhuti. Well said. So it is, Subhuti. It is as you say. The Tathagata blesses fearless bodhisattvas with the best of blessings and entrusts fearless bodhisattvas with the greatest of trusts. You should therefore truly listen, Subhuti, and consider this well. I shall tell you how those who set forth on the bodhisattva path should stand, how they should walk, and how they should control their thoughts.”\n\nThe venerable Subhuti answered, “May it be so, Bhagavan,” and gave his full attention.\n\n## Chapter Thirty-Two\n\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if a fearless bodhisattva filled measureless, infinite worlds with the seven jewels and gave them as an offering to the tathagatas, the arhans, the fully-enlightened ones, and a noble son or daughter grasped but a single four-line gatha of this teaching of the perfection of wisdom and memorized, discussed, recited, mastered, and explained it in detail to others, the body of merit produced by that noble son or daughter as a result would be immeasurably, infinitely greater. And how should they explain it? By not explaining. Thus is it called ‘explaining.’\n\nAs a lamp, a cataract, a star in space  \nAn illusion, a dewdrop, a bubble  \nA dream, a cloud, a flash of lightning  \nView all created things like this.[^1]\n\nAll this was spoken by the Buddha to the joy of the elder Subhuti, the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the bodhisattvas, the devas, humans, asuras and gandharvas of the world all of whom were greatly pleased with what the Buddha said.\n\n[^1]: The classic translation being:\n    \n    So you should view this fleeting world -  \n    A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream,  \n    A flash of lightening in a summer cloud,  \n    A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var u=Object.create;var s=Object.defineProperty;var c=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var f=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var b=Object.getPrototypeOf,w=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(t,e)=>()=>(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),p=(t,e)=>{for(var h in e)s(t,h,{get:e[h],enumerable:!0})},i=(t,e,h,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let n of f(e))!w.call(t,n)&&n!==h&&s(t,n,{get:()=>e[n],enumerable:!(o=c(e,n))||o.enumerable});return t};var m=(t,e,h)=>(h=t!=null?u(b(t)):{},i(e||!t||!t.__esModule?s(h,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):h,t)),v=t=>i(s({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var r=g((A,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var L={};p(L,{default:()=>B,frontmatter:()=>y});var a=m(r()),y={title:\"Diamond Sutra translated by Red Pine (Bill Porter)\"};function d(t){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",br:\"br\",sup:\"sup\",section:\"section\",ol:\"ol\",li:\"li\"},t.components);return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:'Source: \"The Diamond Sutra: The Perfection of Wisdom : Text and Commentaries Translated From Sanskrit and Chinese\"'}),`\n`,(0,a.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"chapter-one\",children:[(0,a.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#chapter-one\",children:(0,a.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,a.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Chapter One\"]}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Thus have I heard: Once the Bhagavan was dwelling near Shravasti at Anathapindada Garden in Jeta Forest together with the full assembly of 1250 bhikshus and a great many fearless bodhisattvas.\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"One day before noon, the Bhagavan put on his patched robe and picked up his bowl and entered the capital of Shravasti for offerings.
