At the age of 13, he left his home near Shanghai to become a monk. During the period of Communist unrest, he went to southern Taiwan and spent six years in solitary retreat. Later, he continued his formal study, earning a doctorate in Buddhist Literature from Rissho University in Tokyo. He has received transmission in the two major branches of Ch'an: the Lin-chi (Rinzai) and Ts'ao-tung (Soto) schools.\n\nHe now divides his time between New York, where he is the Resident Teacher at the Ch'an Meditation Center he Founded, and Taipei, where he is the abbot of two monasteries.\n\nMaster Sheng-yen offers a guide to Ch'an practice based on the poem Faith in Mind.

He is mentioned, however, in the T'ang dynasty (618-907) Kao Seng Chua (Biographies of Eminent Monks) written by master Fa Ts'ung; \"After Ch'an master (Hui) K'o, there was Ch'an master (Seng) Ts'an.\" The Leng Ch'ieh Shih Tzu Chi (Records of the Masters of the Lankavatara Sutra), which contains early historical material of the Ch'an school, says that after entering retreat in the mountains Seng Ts'an never emerged, nor did he ever write about or transmit the Dharma. This statement is problematic considering that the Sui dynasty history, in Er Shih Wu Shih (The Twenty-five History Books) states that in 592 he transmitted the Dharma to Tao Hsin, the Fourth Patriarch. It also calls into question the authorship of the poem Faith in Mind, which has historically been attributed to Seng Ts'an. Contemporary scholars doubt whether he was, in fact, the author. Niu T'ou Fa Jung, a disciple of Tao Hsin, wrote a poem entitled Song of Mind. Noticing the similarity between the two poems, some suggest that Faith in Mind was actually written after the time of the Sixth Patriarch, Nui Neng, as an improved, condensed version of Song of Mind. The thought expressed in Faith in Mind is indeed better organized, more concise and seems complete compared to Niu T'ou's poem.\n\nThe question of attribution, however, has no relevance to my commentaries on Faith in Mind. The importance of the poem to us lies in its value as a guide to Ch'an meditation, and its significance in the history of Ch'an (Zen), both in China and Japan. Among the many poems on enlightenment, the most highly regarded are Yung Chia's Song of Enlightenment, and Faith in Mind, because of the clear guidance they provide on the method of Ch'an.\n\nFor this reason, I do not comment on Faith in Mind on ordinary occasions. I choose to lecture on it only during the seven-day Ch'an retreat. The twenty chapters of this book are based on translated lectures spanning four retreats, subsequently edited for publication. Since the talks were given within the context of intensive meditation practice, I did not adopt a scholarly point of view or analytical approach. It is not a formal commentary on the text; rather, I use the poem as a taking-off point to inspire the practitioner and deal with certain issues that arise during the course of practice.\n\nThere are at least five published English translations of Faith in Mind. All have their merits. I offer a new translation which is similar in many respects to previous ones; however, portions of it are quite different, reflecting my own understanding of the poem. When commenting on Faith in Mind, I often say to my students, \"Now that you are practicing, it matters little whether or not I speak on Faith in Mind. But I am using the poem to instruct you on the method of practice.\" The progress and condition of a given group of practitioners differs from day to day and from retreat to retreat. Thus I adapt my discussion of the poem to the situation at hand, while remaining within the scope of the text. I believe these talks can serve as a helpful guide both to the aspiring and experienced practitioner. It has also helped me personally, by giving me new insights into the poem as various situations arose.\n\nThe phrase \"faith in mind\" contains the two meanings of \"believing in\" and \"realizing\" the mind. \"Mind\" is especially emphasized in Ch'an. True faith in mind is the belief grounded in realization that we have a fundamental, unmoving, unchanging mind. This mind is precisely Buddha mind; it is also Tathagatagarbha (womb of Tathagata) in every sentient being. But the mind experienced by ordinary beings in the midst of vexations is deluded mind, not true mind. Those who seek to rid themselves of vexations imagine that there is a true mind to attain. However, from the perspective of Buddha mind, there is only one mind, neither true nor false. There is no need to discriminate, for everything, everywhere, is mind everlasting. When we fully realize Buddha mind, the believing mind and the mind which is believed in merge into one; since they are the same, the need for mere belief in this mind disappears.\n\nThe paradox is that one must be enlightened to have true faith in this mind. The author is speaking from a deeply enlightened perspective to the practitioner who seeks to discover true mind. Seng Ts'an shows us how to transform our ordinary discriminating mind into the Buddha mind which does not discriminates; how to get from existence to emptiness, from defilement to purity. He tells us how we should practice and what kind of mental attitude to avoid during practice: we should not give in to our likes and dislikes, neither trying to negate our vexations nor seeking enlightenment. The practice should be pursued for its own sake, but while there should be no other purpose, in the end the mind of equanimity (ping deng hsin is realized - there is no discrimination, no need for language (yen yu tao tuan), or, indeed, of practice.\n\nThe poem contains phrases that will later on assume importance in the Ts'ao Tung (Soto) sect of Ch'an, for instance, \"One thought for ten thousand years\" (i nien wan nien), which expresses the idea of one thought not moving and yet illuminating. This idea is to become the hallmark of Hung Chih Cheng Chueh's Silent Illumination Ch'an. This tendency is also repeated in the only other written record of Seng Ts'an's teachings which was found on a stone tablet commemorating him. The essence of the inscription is: Simultaneously practice stillness (chi) and illumination (chao). Carefully observe, but see no dharmas (phenomena), see no body, and see no mind. For the mind is nameless, the body is empty, and the dharmas are a dream. There is nothing to be attained, no enlightenment to be experienced. This is called liberation.\n\n## Faith In Mind\n\nThe Supreme Way is not difficult  \nIf only you do not pick and choose.  \nNeither love nor hate,  \nAnd you will clearly understand.  \nBe off by a hair,  \nAnd you are as far from it as heaven from earth.  \nIf you want the Way to appear,  \nBe neither for nor against.  \nFor and against opposing each other  \nThis is the mind's disease.  \nWithout recognizing the mysterious principle  \nIt is useless to practice quietude.  \n\nThe Way is perfect like great space,  \nWithout lack, without excess.  \nBecause of grasping and rejecting,  \nYou cannot attain it.  \nDo not pursue conditioned existence;  \nDo not abide in acceptance of emptiness.  \nIn oneness and equality,  \nConfusion vanishes of itself.  \nStop activity and return to stillness,  \nAnd that stillness will be even more active.  \nMerely stagnating in duality,  \nHow can you recognize oneness?  \n\nIf you fail to penetrate oneness,  \nBoth places lose their function.  \nBanish existence and you fall into existence;  \nFollow emptiness and you turn your back on it.  \nExcessive talking and thinking  \nTurn you from harmony with the Way.  \nCut off talking and thinking,  \nAnd there is nowhere you cannot penetrate.  \nReturn to the root and attain the principle;  \nPursue illumination and you lose it.  \nOne moment of reversing the light  \nIs greater than the previous emptiness.  \nThe previous emptiness is transformed;  \nIt was all a product of deluded views.  \nNo need to seek the real;  \nJust extinguish your views.  \n\nDo not abide in dualistic views;  \nTake care not to seek after them.  \nAs soon as there is right and wrong  \nThe mind is scattered and lost.  \nTwo comes from one,  \nYet do not even keep the one.  \nWhen one mind does not arise,  \nMyriad dharmas are without defect.  \nWithout defect, without dharmas,  \nNo arising, no mind.  \nThe subject is extinguished with the object.  \nThe object sinks away with the subject.  \nObject is object because of the subject;  \nSubject is subject because of the object.  \nKnow that the two  \nAre originally one emptiness.  \nIn one emptiness the two are the same,  \nContaining all phenomena.  \nNot seeing fine or coarse,  \nHow can there be any bias?  \n\nThe Great Way is broad,  \nNeither easy nor difficult.  \nWith narrow views and doubts,  \nHaste will slow you down.  \nAttach to it and you lose the measure;  \nThe mind will enter a deviant path.  \nLet it go and be spontaneous,  \nExperience no going or staying.  \n\nAccord with your nature, unite with the Way,  \nWander at ease, without vexation.  \nBound by thoughts, you depart from the real;  \nAnd sinking into a stupor is as bad.  \nIt is not good to weary the spirit.  \nWhy alternate between aversion and affection?  \n\nIf you wish to enter the one vehicle,  \nDo not be repelled by the sense realm.  \nWith no aversion to the sense realm,  \nYou become one with true enlightenment.  \nThe wise have no motives;  \nFools put themselves in bondage.  \nOne dharma is not different from another.  \nThe deluded mind clings to whatever it desires.  \nUsing mind to cultivate mind  \nIs this not a great mistake?  \n\nThe erring mind begets tranquillity and confusion;  \nIn enlightenment there are no likes or dislikes.  \nThe duality of all things  \nIssues from false discriminations.  \nA dream, an illusion, a flower in the sky  \nHow could they be worth grasping?  \nGain and loss, right and wrong  \nDiscard them all at once.  \n\nIf the eyes do not close in sleep,  \nAll dreams will cease of themselves.  \nIf the mind does not discriminate,  \nAll dharmas are of one suchness.  \nThe essence of one suchness is profound;  \nUnmoving, conditioned things are forgotten.  \nContemplate all dharmas as equal,  \nAnd you return to things as they are.  \nWhen the subject disappears,  \nThere can be no measuring or comparing.  \n\nStop activity and there is no activity;  \nWhen activity stops, there is no rest.  \nSince two cannot be established,  \nHow can there be one?  \nIn the very ultimate,  \nRules and standards do not exist.  \n\nDevelop a mind of equanimity,  \nAnd all deeds are put to rest.  \nAnxious doubts are completely cleared.  \nRight faith is made upright.  \nNothing lingers behind,  \nNothing can be remembered.  \nBright and empty, functioning naturally,  \nThe mind does not exert itself.  \nIt is not a place of thinking,  \nDifficult for reason and emotion to fathom.  \nIn the Dharma Realm of true suchness,  \nThere is no other, no self.  \n\nTo accord with it is vitally important;  \nOnly refer to not-two.  \nIn not-two all things are in unity;  \nNothing is excluded.  \nThe wise throughout the ten directions  \nAll enter this principle.  \nThis principle is neither hurried nor slow  \nOne thought for ten thousand years.  \n\nAbiding nowhere yet everywhere,  \nThe ten directions are right before you.  \nThe smallest is the same as the largest  \nIn the realm where delusion is cut off.  \nThe largest is the same as the smallest;  \nNo boundaries are visible.  \nExistence is precisely emptiness;  \nEmptiness is precisely existence.  \nIf it is not like this,  \nThen you must not preserve it.  \n\nOne is everything;  \nEverything is one.  \nIf you can be like this,  \nWhy worry about not finishing?  \nFaith and mind are not two;  \nNon-duality is faith in mind.  \n\nThe path of words is cut off;  \nThere is no past, no future, no present.  \n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var b=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(t,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),g=(t,e)=\u003e{for(var i in e)o(t,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},s=(t,e,i,r)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of m(e))!p.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026a!==i\u0026\u0026o(t,a,{get:()=\u003ee[a],enumerable:!(r=u(e,a))||r.enumerable});return t};var y=(t,e,i)=\u003e(i=t!=null?c(b(t)):{},s(e||!t||!t.__esModule?o(i,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):i,t)),w=t=\u003es(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var d=f((C,h)=\u003e{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var I={};g(I,{default:()=\u003ex,frontmatter:()=\u003ev});var n=y(d()),v={title:\"Faith in Mind by Seng Ts'an translated by Master Sheng-yen\"};function l(t){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",br:\"br\"},t.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"Source: \",(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://terebess.hu/english/hsin3.html\",children:\"https://terebess.hu/english/hsin3.html\"})]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"preface\",children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#preface\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Preface\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Master Sheng-yen (1931-2009) is a renowned teacher of Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism.
