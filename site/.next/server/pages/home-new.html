It seems as if we are not equipped to talk collectively about something that might be the first consequence of climate change.\n\n## Yet the food crisis is no longer a threat but a reality\n\nThe globalization of our food production system no longer allows territories to ensure food sovereignty. The war in Ukraine has made its fragility visible.\n\nMono-cropping generates the risk of crop-destroying diseases in an almost constant way, and its adoption has contributed to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, soil health, and water tables.\n\nWe are in a continuous state of crisis management between war, disease and water shortages, and this is only accelerating. According to David Bailey, Director of the World Food Programme: \"After Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and southern Sudan, it is Somalia's turn to join the list of countries facing famine in 2023\". Food insecurity also appears to be on the rise within Europe. Today in France, for example, 30% of the population now have difficulty in obtaining healthy food with three meals a day. \n\nWe know the answer to this crisis. It is mainly structural: regain our food sovereignty by producing a locally autonomous agriculture mainly focused on plant production for humans (today ⅔ of agricultural land in France is dedicated to industrial animal feed). This general movement is underway, helped by public authorities and the PAT (territorial management plan  in France) among other initiatives. \n\nBut given the time needed to transform a globalized agricultural system, the time we have left may not be enough.   \n\nFurthermore, our relationship with food must evolve if we aim to be realistic, along with the time we dedicate to this activity – a duration that has decreased from 4 hours to 1 hour over the past 80 years in France.\n\nOn the other hand, if the change in agriculture will take several decades, the way in which we can change our relationship with food at home, in our communities and start to build an emotional resilience to the possible reduction in food shortage , can happen on time.\n\n## It is in this window that cooks have a crucial role to play. \n\nThey still have the time to develop culinary practices and connections that allow them to satisfy bodies and hearts in a deeper way that could bring peace to people and reduce anxiety. \n\nWe have enough time to develop a social technology that can withstand the panic of food insecurity and create a space of emotional security in the face of food anxiety and thus prototype a new food culture based on \"just enough\".\n\nIt is therefore urgent to ask the question of what are the strategies that will allow us not only to regulate ourselves emotionally in order to overcome the fear of the coming shortage, but also to rediscover the joy of living and creativity through the management of food as a collective.\n  \nThese models will not be able to emanate from a single axis such as anti-waste,fermentation, or solar cooking, but from a food ecosystem that allows us to respond to the fear of lack through the life force generated by community embodiment.  \n\nI see this evolution as a multi-pointed star: \n\n-    Good practice as humanity did before the Second World War: \n    \n-   support the farmers who feed us healthily \n    \n-   return to a way of cooking using few animal products and based mainly on cereals, vegetables and beans \n    \n-   relearn how to transform the abundance of summer into winter stock (fermentations, jars, sauces, dehydration). \n    \n-   no longer throwing away but systematically recycling \n    \n-   consider a way of cooking that respects the natural taste of the ingredients to achieve satiety that generates less appetite. \n    \n-   think of cooking in terms of balanced menus that generate satiety through variety (flavors, textures) rather than quantity \n    \n-   invent or adapting rituals to calm the fear of missing out \n    \n-   integrate contemplative silence into meals \n    \n-   generate the desire to increase the time devoted to our food (in the 1950 we spent 4 hours per day per household on food activities compared to 1 hour since 1990). \n    \n-   Deconstructing the notion of a fixed personal need: Developing facilities to realize the direct link between our relationship with food and the way it is produced. And if there is suffering, recognise the cultural responsibility of a system based on the fear of lack. \n\n### A Change of Posture \n\nEngage in revolution not because of the crisis but because of the joy and sense of belonging others that it brings. By the creative possibilities it can generate when we allow ourselves to be in-formed by its nourishment, developing our natural capacity to hear deeply what needs to be done and how.\n\nA dynamic posture that as Matt (current Life itself Praxis Hub resident) expressed it touches on rhythm in community. How to invite ourselves collectively to reappropriate food activities to be placed at the heart of the collective, and how to rethink food in movements integrated into a geography, a territory: the vegetable garden even if small, a lacto-fermentation lab, an oyster mushroom or shiitake culture, a dehydration space, a solar or terrestrial kitchen or any other idea that can both generate joy in a group and food resilience.  \n\n### The invisible power of collective activity \n\nTaking an interest in food collectively is, first and foremost, about organizing together, co-creating and sharing. It is the way to regain that sense of belonging that is essential to our emotional and mental equilibrium. In the context of mental health that is deteriorating exponentially and particularly among young people, proposing simple practices that make sense to live with others can transform the fear of the future into something more joyful. \n\nIt is therefore time for cooks to come together, to think together, to share their knowledge, to give themselves credibility and to mobilize as a living force of the transition in order to use their immense creativity and passion for the world in the development of processes that allow for a resilient food system in communities.\n\nTo Build together a different food narrative that empowers people, even in the midst of collapse. \n\nMy practice as a cook is directly inspired by the Tenzo practice of the Zen temples which, over the course of 800 years, have adressed the issue in such a way that it can serve as an inspiring framework. \n\nThe rest is up to the cooks, how to let yourself be inspired by collective creativity and let the solutions emerge in a relaxed and confident way? \n\nIn any case, this is my commitment and my passion at the Praxis Hub in Bergerac.\n\nIf these resonate in you like a call, then don't hesitate and come and join me in helping to pioneer the next food culture. \n\n\u003e[[../../../../sympoiesis/conscious-food-workshop-june-2023|Join the upcoming conscious food residency]]\n\n\n\n---\n#### Sources\n\n 1.

It seems as if we are not equipped to talk collectively about something that might be the first consequence of climate change.\n\n\nThe globalization of our food production system no longer allows territories to ensure food sovereignty. The war in Ukraine has made its fragility visible.\n\nMono-cropping generates the risk of crop-destroying diseases in an almost constant way, and its adoption has contributed to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, soil health, and water tables.\n\nWe are in a continuous state of crisis management between war, disease and water shortages, and this is only accelerating. According to David Bailey, Director of the World Food Programme: \"After Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and southern Sudan, it is Somalia's turn to join the list of countries facing famine in 2023\". Food insecurity also appears to be on the rise within Europe. Today in France, for example, 30% of the population now have difficulty in obtaining healthy food with three meals a day. \n\nWe know the answer to this crisis. It is mainly structural: regain our food sovereignty by producing a locally autonomous agriculture mainly focused on plant production for humans (today ⅔ of agricultural land in France is dedicated to industrial animal feed). This general movement is underway, helped by public authorities and the PAT (territorial management plan  in France) among other initiatives. \n\nBut given the time needed to transform a globalized agricultural system, the time we have left may not be enough.   \n\nFurthermore, our relationship with food must evolve if we aim to be realistic, along with the time we dedicate to this activity – a duration that has decreased from 4 hours to 1 hour over the past 80 years in France.\n\nOn the other hand, if the change in agriculture will take several decades, the way in which we can change our relationship with food at home, in our communities and start to build an emotional resilience to the possible reduction in food shortage , can happen on time.\n\n\nThey still have the time to develop culinary practices and connections that allow them to satisfy bodies and hearts in a deeper way that could bring peace to people and reduce anxiety. \n\nWe have enough time to develop a social technology that can withstand the panic of food insecurity and create a space of emotional security in the face of food anxiety and thus prototype a new food culture based on \"just enough\".\n\nIt is therefore urgent to ask the question of what are the strategies that will allow us not only to regulate ourselves emotionally in order to overcome the fear of the coming shortage, but also to rediscover the joy of living and creativity through the management of food as a collective.\n  \nThese models will not be able to emanate from a single axis such as anti-waste,fermentation, or solar cooking, but from a food ecosystem that allows us to respond to the fear of lack through the life force generated by community embodiment.  \n\nI see this evolution as a multi-pointed star: \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nEngage in revolution not because of the crisis but because of the joy and sense of belonging others that it brings. By the creative possibilities it can generate when we allow ourselves to be in-formed by its nourishment, developing our natural capacity to hear deeply what needs to be done and how.\n\nA dynamic posture that as Matt (current Life itself Praxis Hub resident) expressed it touches on rhythm in community. How to invite ourselves collectively to reappropriate food activities to be placed at the heart of the collective, and how to rethink food in movements integrated into a geography, a territory: the vegetable garden even if small, a lacto-fermentation lab, an oyster mushroom or shiitake culture, a dehydration space, a solar or terrestrial kitchen or any other idea that can both generate joy in a group and food resilience.  \n\n\nTaking an interest in food collectively is, first and foremost, about organizing together, co-creating and sharing. It is the way to regain that sense of belonging that is essential to our emotional and mental equilibrium. In the context of mental health that is deteriorating exponentially and particularly among young people, proposing simple practices that make sense to live with others can transform the fear of the future into something more joyful. \n\nIt is therefore time for cooks to come together, to think together, to share their knowledge, to give themselves credibility and to mobilize as a living force of the transition in order to use their immense creativity and passion for the world in the development of processes that allow for a resilient food system in communities.\n\nTo Build together a different food narrative that empowers people, even in the midst of collapse. \n\nMy practice as a cook is directly inspired by the Tenzo practice of the Zen temples which, over the course of 800 years, have adressed the issue in such a way that it can serve as an inspiring framework. \n\nThe rest is up to the cooks, how to let yourself be inspired by collective creativity and let the solutions emerge in a relaxed and confident way? \n\nIn any case, this is my commitment and my passion at the Praxis Hub in Bergerac.\n\nIf these resonate in you like a call, then don't hesitate and come and join me in helping to pioneer the next food culture. \n\n\u003e[[../../../../sympoiesis/conscious-food-workshop-june-2023|Join the upcoming conscious food residency]]\n\n\n\n---\n\n 1.

My job was simply to write it down and share it. Below you’ll find what came to me, which you can also watch in the video. \n\nI might just add an invitation to reflect on how you’re in touch with the world. Humans use touch to communicate non-verbally, often unconsciously, and I wonder what you say to others, to the more-than-human, and to yourself. \n\nI have spent years picking and prodding at my own body, saying “be small and smooth” instead of “thank you for holding me on this beautiful planet”. \n\nThe messages I give to my own body are the same ones I communicate to the life around me. I admit that my hands have often tried to fix and change rather than meet others with curiosity and thanks.  \n\nSo, for myself and for you, I pose two additional questions to the ones in the video:\n\n1.  How might we touch with reverence for life itself, rather than life’s utility?\n    \n2.   How might we touch in a dynamic of gracious attunement, rather than transaction? \n\n\n\u003e **Be sure to join our [online community chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JNJCTZugNQn1fq89xbHtfA)and join the next community call, with another exciting presentation!**\n\n\n## The Presentation\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6p0dKyFCmA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nI’m surprised by the threads I’m weaving together— philosophy of touch, relational ontology, grocery technology, the attention economy, and tactile practices of gratitude. But I heard a clear voice in my head saying, “Trust the path I sent you on.” I am trusting. \n\nThe combination of the subjects is new to me, but the threads themselves are not. I’ve been long nourished by these ideas, starting at my parents’ dinner table. It was a place of rosemary and thyme, of perfect and irreplicable soups. A place of heated debate, where one side saw the “health food store” as a safe haven and the other side saw it as the headquarters for the local elite (this was not a good thing). \n\nAnd touch? This thread is as old as my time here. As the first sense to develop in the womb, I felt in my earliest days that I was held utterly and completely by the world. Now on the outside, I’m still held utterly and completely though it feels different. \n\nTouch, surprisingly sitting in the middle on my list of love languages, is what I’ve studied for years. I learned that my culture ranks the senses in a hierarchy. Seeing and hearing sit at the top and are associated with the intellect, the mind, and men. Taste, smell, and touch are base, and of the body, associated with emotion and women. They are to be avoided in serious circles. \n\nBut touch, as I’m sure is the same with smell and taste, is so beautiful in its base fleshiness, emotion, and possibly its femininity. Our very embodiment means that we’re connected with the world, a truth we cannot shirk though some might try with dreams of a “disembodied” metaverse. Touch—the thing we cannot not do—is both an example and metaphor of our primordial interconnectedness. \n\nBut let’s get real. Hold your own hand. Try to find the precise boundary between one and the other. Try to discern which hand is touching and which hand is touched. \n\nYou’ll find that the sense eludes the binaries clever minds try to uphold. Our skin, just like our place in the world, is porous. Touching is never a mere connection between two things, one and two, but always is an infusion that darts a sly smile at individualism. \n\nResearch shows that humans are remarkably good at communicating nonverbally through touch. Nurses, for example, explained that prejudices and biases that don’t make it out of the mouth will find their way out in the hands. Some people are told, without words, that they deserve to be handled with kindness and others are told they are worthy of neglect and harshness. \n\nThis goes beyond the hospital walls. Some are led carefully and some are choked. Some boundaries are respected and some are transgressed. And as I wait for my son to be born, I wonder if I will handle him differently than I did my daughter.\n\nWhat, I wonder, do you and I say to the more-than-human world with our feet, hands and flesh of our cheeks? Years ago I wandered a meadow and felt paralyzed by my inability not to destroy the plants. Wherever I stood, however I sat, I squashed. I was horrified. Perhaps, then, touch has something to teach me about how my culture separates life and death. \n\nWe may turn to the more-than-human world we each touch in varying degrees each day. Food. That which nourishes us. We pick and squeeze, peel and chop, lift to our noses and place on our tongues. How often are these moments ones where thanks is communicated? How often is it that food is tossed, shoved, and treated without care?   \n\nIn the last years so much of this initial relationship building with food has been traded for scrolling and clicking on a smooth screen. Online grocery shopping was sometimes necessary under pandemic restrictions and has become ingrained in many of our weekly habits. Though we have personal relationships with our screens, it’s a surface without the particularity of a lemon rind or the skin of a unique tomato. Under the insidious guise of efficiency and the cultural obsession with optimizing every minute of daily life, we have lost so many opportunities to connect with our food.  \n\nI’m experimenting with reconnecting. My weekly shopping is now spread over several small shops and I feel what comes home with me. With my hands, I ask the lemons who would like to join the basket. This attentive and caring kind of touch magically transforms the very metaphysics of my kitchen. With a toddler the hours between 5-7pm require dinner, bath and bedtime. Until recently these two hours were fraught with urgency and felt constricting. Every time I turned around I would bump into something. \n\nThen I started touching with intention, sweetly saying with my hands, “thank you cauliflower” and “much gratitude onion!”. Suddenly the hours between 5-7pm became infused with spaciousness. Now there’s enough time and more than enough space—even with a little girl at my feet playing with pots. My shoulders unclench and there’s more ease.   \n\nI’m always already in touch with the world. But by adding some attention, I’m able to connect with more care. \n\nAnd so, I ask: If touch is such a powerful communicator, what do you say to your food? Do you speak words of domination and extraction? Or ones of thanks? Might you try out the latter a little more?\n\n\u003e Madelaine is a philosopher and explorer of care, politics, feminism, ecology and our relationship with technology.

That said, if you are in any way interested in Web3, the guide provides a useful perspective which is often missing from the mainstream crypto narrative. \n\nWeb3 \u0026 crypto has become a massive phenomenon with bold claims made about its actual and potential impact. These claims go far beyond traditional technology boosterism (better, faster) to claims for radical transformation (and improvement) of our economic and social systems – for example, Web3 is revolutionary for X where X is everything from [money](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/money) and the economy to governance to funding [public goods](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/public-goods-problem) like (open) software, carbon removal etc.\n\nAs you may know, Life Itself is all about creating a wiser, weller world and you might assume that crypto and Web3 would fit into our repertoire of tools like fingers in a glove. Yet, during our initial exploration we felt that the Web3 space lacked the rigorous sensemaking necessary to make an informed decision about whether the claims were legitimate.  \n\n“As someone who aligns closely with many of the more progressive aspirations of the Web3 space, I think it’s really important we have an honest, good faith conversation about whether these technologies are the best way of fulfilling them,” says Theo Cox, Head of Life Itself Labs. \n\n“Too often discussions fracture into tribalism, with mud slinging from both sides on the basis of affiliations and vested interests. I wanted to move past that, into a space of “hey, we all want the same thing here. I may be more skeptical around Web3 as a way to achieve that, but here’s a detailed breakdown of the evidence and reasoning for my view so if you disagree, let’s talk”.\n\nThere was a gap in the collective knowledge surrounding Web3 and while there were many people critiquing its claims, no rigorous analysis had been made. So we did it! \n\n“To my knowledge this is the most detailed and evidence-based breakdown of the key claims made about Web3 technology. I hope it can not only help people make sense of the underlying mechanics of what’s going on, but also spark a more productive conversation. I’d love nothing more than for this to lead to discussions with people who disagree which move us all closer to our shared aspirations,” says Theo.\n  \n## What does the guide contain?\n\nThe guide explores the social, economical and political aspects of Web3 and Crypto with a particular focus on making sense of key claims often touted by proponents of Web3.  \n\nBy steel-manning these key claims through conscious, critical and open-minded dialog with a diverse set of experts, the guide teases out the underlying hypotheses and assumptions and then engages in rigorous and constructive critique. \n\nThe guide also explores the overall aspirations of the Web3 movement and examines how these might be achieved, whether through improvements to [blockchain](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/blockchain) based approaches or by other means.\n\nAll of this is neatly packaged into a stand-alone website from which the entire guide can be explored. It is split into three main sections: \n\n1.  Full analyses providing comprehensive and authoritative analyses of the biggest claims being made in the space. The following claims are analyzed:\n    \n\n-   [Bitcoin will (and should) become the new gold standard](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-bitcoin-will-and-should-become-the-new-gold-standard)\n    \n-   [Crypto will provide better payment and remittance services](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-will-provide-better-payment-and-remittance-services)\n    \n-   [Crypto can help solve the public goods problem](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-help-solve-the-public-goods-problem)\n    \n-   [Web3 can help revolutionize cooperation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-web3-can-help-revolutionize-cooperation)\n    \n-   [Crypto can provide better means of financializing non-financial value](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-provide-better-means-of-financializing-non-financial-value)\n    \n\n2.  Deep dive notes, which are detailed analysis notes from our deep dive conversations. These have not yet been formatted and expanded into full analyses ([You can help](https://web3.lifeitself.org/meta/editing)). We've undertaken deep dives on the following claims:\n    \n\n-   [Blockchain can (and should) be used to create “networked states” to replace existing nation states](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-blockchain-can-and-should-be-used-to-create-networked-states-to-replace-existing-nation-states)\n    \n-   [Crypto can act as an anti-authoritarian force](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-act-as-an-anti-authoritarian-force)\n    \n-   [The crypto space is just an unfettered market, and there’s nothing wrong with that](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-the-crypto-space-is-just-an-unfettered-market-and-theres-nothing-wrong-with-that)\n    \n-   [Crypto is just the latest evolution of fintech, and is leading us towards a better financial system](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-is-just-the-latest-evolution-of-fintech-and-is-leading-us-towards-a-better-financial-system)\n    \n-   [Crypto should remain outside of securities regulation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-should-remain-outside-of-securities-regulation)\n    \n\n3.  Finally, FAQs are brief responses to some common questions asked about crypto and Web3.

How indeed can I remain idle in front of the homeless, the slaughtered animals, the beaten women and children, how can I not act to help people who are victims of social injustice, of racism, how can I not rush to the people who are stranded on our coasts etc.?\n\nHowever, in my experience, when I adopt a posture of circumspection, then the larger question appears of what builds this common sense, what is at the origin of our actions?\n\nIn my cultural context this common-sense-activist perspective of me sitting on the cushion seems to stem from: \n\n* The intention to do good \n- The deep conviction that we are fully capable of analyzing a problem and therefore of solving it. \n- The certainty that once the problem is analyzed, it is enough to act on it. \n\nBut this ordinary functioning of reactivity to the world, is for me informed by the special human ability to forget to question the way in which our personal ethics or our capacity to perceive reality is constructed.\n \nAnd it is realistic to conceive that what we perceive as \"reality\" most often concerns our projections resulting in a phenomenal co-production of all the experiences we have lived since our childhood and even earlier. \n\nWe also forget to question the intention with which we carry out our actions and that an enthusiasm based solely on the morality of the good can also have the effect of feeding the tensions that we are trying to resolve. \n\nSo what does a cushion have to offer me? How can I have the nerve to say that it is by sitting down that I will find another answer to the infinite boomerang effect of my most beautiful impulses? And how can I benefit from this sitting when I walk the path of activism? How can I hear what sounds like an irreconcilable paradox: the activism of contemplation in the form of sitting, begging, deep listening circles, silent retreats of all that sits the body mind?   \n\n## Simply sitting \n\n\"When I eat I eat, when I sleep I sleep\" says the wise man.\n\nSitting down and then, in this state of non manufacturing of thoughts, getting up from the cushion to cook, eat and simply live is the deeply disturbing proposal of sitting without a goal in front of the complexity of the world. At first sight it seems insane, but it is just as relevant as the one that consists in following without stopping for a moment everything we think we should do in the name of a conditioned good. \n\nSitting with a relaxed back and a straight spine (on the floor or on a chair, it doesn't matter) is our natural posture, that of babies who without tension stand with their spine spread out on their sacrum, and at the same time something extremely complicated, so much so that in our lives we have lost the sense of balance, so much so that we struggle against the gravity of the earth.  \nCarried by our thoughts, it is often our head that drives our body, physically but also mentally because our being is body-mind, whether we like it or not. The one cannot be separated from the other except conceptually.\n\nTo observe ourselves walking is very interesting if we want to know our relationship to the world: do we put our head first or our steps? Can we bring our upper body backwards without feeling fear or, on the contrary, confidence? Do we allow ourselves to stop and let go of the weight along the spine, release tension and automatically feel the opening of another space for thought/action? \n\nThe Alexander Technique approach to body posture talks about direction and inhibition. The concept is disarmingly simple: since early childhood we have produced conditioned reflexes which are often useless and tiring as we strain against the various injunctions of our parents and then of society. Thus, even the way we get up from a chair calls upon most of the back muscles (the volitional muscles) when our body is made in such a way that it has the freedom, when given the possibility, to function without tensing up (thanks to the deep muscles).\n\nThe methodology of the Alexander technique is literally \"not doing\": we put the intention to stand up (set the direction) but we don't do it, and in this space freed from conditioned movement, we relax and allow the deep muscles to take over. When we start moving again, in our direction, it is done without any effort. This simple pause \"between intention and action\" will deconstruct the muscular-mental body habit and offer again the possibility to the body-mind to function more freely in the adjusted and not conditioned effort. \n\nThis approach to non-doing is similar to the 'sitting without purpose' meditation of zazen in Japanese. As Issho Fujita says in his footnotes on zazen, \n“When we are absorbed in our thoughts, thinking about this or that - as usual - it is a function of the 'muscular-outer mind'. In the common French expression, we say: \"use your head\". In contrast, the \"inner mind muscle\" has the function of supporting the appearance and disappearance of thoughts at the basic level. It allows intuition, awareness and full consciousness to appear. Here again, in zazen, we can say that we are calming down an excessive activity of outer mind muscle and activating and\nmanifesting the function of the inner mind muscle which has been suppressed.\n\nDeveloped by Master Dogen in the 12th century, the particularity of zazen is that the mind of \"not doing\" goes through the posture of the body. His vision is still to this day considered radical in Buddhism, as it affirms the possibility of freeing ourselves from our conditioned reflexes by simply sitting; he goes as far as to affirm that awakening is the posture. To understand a little better what Dogen means by posture but also in what brings us to consider this practice of uninhibited posture as activism (of contemplation), we have to go back to the school of philosophy of Yogacara founded by Vasubandhu around the 5th century. \n\nThis philosophy speaks to us (as does all of Buddhism) about the confusion between reality as it is and our perception of the world. It is radically based on the fact that nothing has its own substance. Matter is formed and deformed according to the perception of the observer who influences the reality of this matter. Nothing exists in itself but is a game of crossed perceptions conditioning the actions resulting from it, themselves products of our projections. Nihilism is not far away and Dogen’s philosophy has often been judged as such but this is to misunderstand its purpose; on the contrary, it is at the root of contemplative activism.\n\nIn Yogacara school, the notion of a \"memory chamber of our consciousness\" is proposed, where all our actions and the experience we have gained from them are stored: Alaya Vijnaya. The school also proposes the space of the ego (manas) which would draw from this \"memory chamber\" of how to make sense of its individuality by creating a history from this fabric of experiences. A very simple example is, if  a child is given sweets every time it works well, it will probably have the desire to celebrate successful work with sweets all their life. \n\nWe find these principles developed later by psychology. But when psychology will rather focus on understanding the constitutive effects of these experiences on our identity and, according to the therapies, influence our behaviors, another proposal will be born from this cartography of the mind: that of dynamic absorption, the simple sitting in the active porosity of life as it is; chan na, zazen in Japanese. \n\nTo take the direction of sitting upright, not doing and letting oneself be unformed by the innate capacity of the body-mind to form itself again in continuity, such is the non-methodology of this sitting.  \n\nThe meaning of this meditation (zazen) is based on the principle that if we cut the causal mechanics existing between the experiential memory (memory chambers) and the way we build ourselves (the ego), we will divert the \"ordinary\" effects of the way we perceive ourselves, the world and our actions. \n\nSo it is really the action that is at stake in this sitting.\n\nCompared to other meditations, the proposal of zazen has the particularity that it has no objective and even the intention of \"letting it happen\" of the posture must be abandoned here, if we want to really \"let it happen\". Here, all the thoughts constructed by Alaya and filtered by Manas are left to themselves and stop making the tensions of acting and doing, certainties and opinions. We stop the thread of the story that we tell ourselves simply by not participating in it anymore, by not grasping it. Comfortably installed in our conditioning, in full awareness of our illusions, we rest. When the mental productions appear, we say hello to them but without “inviting them to tea” as D.T. Suzuki used to say. \n\nAnd like a computer, the fact of no longer doing, of letting what comes as it comes emerge without keeping or rejecting, we operate, in all unconsciousness, a radical deconstruction of our way of being in the world; a hard disk reset. \n\nSimply by being in the receptive disposition of all that crosses us, we free ourselves from all our conditioning, instantly and without any possibility of seeing it. This is the notion of awakening according to Dogen, an expression of absolute reality that is perfectly elusive and completely outside of any personal desire.  \n\nThis dynamic of Self-realization is a profoundly revolutionary way of living because it no longer seeks to escape from causality but, by diving into it, creates other routes, other possibilities, and, thanks to the receptivity generated by the open posture, it will activate all of our creativity in order to be able to act rather than react. \n\nIt will also, of course, create new causalities, other projections, other illusions because it is our lot as humans to produce thought, first of all with the language that must define, delimit, but if we remain in this movement of never grasping anything, then this sitting promises us from moment to moment the dynamic resilience of an interphenomenal self that adjusts itself infinitely. \n\nIf there is no longer an objective, if there is nothing to reach, to solve, to find, if our transformation no longer depends on us but on our capacity to become receptive, to let ourselves be in-formed rather than always seeking to transform ourselves, then a great relaxation takes place. \n\nFrom this relaxation, a new form of action different from our ordinary way emerges and the true power of action is activated as a result of this continuous deconstruction of our conditioned self. \n\nIt is in this that the posture is activism; contemplative activism.\n\nThe posture of the tenzo (the cook in Zen) is the dynamic expression of this space of inhibition of action in the direction that unfolds in all activities of our life. Its invitation brings us back into the flow of our daily life, bridging the gap between the sitting posture and the deep spirit of the posture that reveals itself in each of our movements. \n\nThe practice of tenzo offers us to dive into all the activities of our life in the relativity of our singularity, in the obligation that we have to choose, to decide to take charge while acting from the same space freed as that of the sitting. \n\nThis is why, to the reaction \"but we can't just sit!\", the response is that we don't just sit, because sitting in this context is first and foremost a dynamic posture that unfolds throughout our lives, in meditation as well as in the kitchen, and everywhere else as long as we set a direction.  \n\nTo explore this topic further join us in the Bergerac Praxis Hub this May. The spirit of posture is something fundamental to the Praxis Hub and will be particularly explored in the next Ouroboros residency (May 2023) in the context of internalized patriarchy.

Suzuki used to say. \n\nAnd like a computer, the fact of no longer doing, of letting what comes as it comes emerge without keeping or rejecting, we operate, in all unconsciousness, a radical deconstruction of our way of being in the world; a hard disk reset. \n\nSimply by being in the receptive disposition of all that crosses us, we free ourselves from all our conditioning, instantly and without any possibility of seeing it. This is the notion of awakening according to Dogen, an expression of absolute reality that is perfectly elusive and completely outside of any personal desire.  \n\nThis dynamic of Self-realization is a profoundly revolutionary way of living because it no longer seeks to escape from causality but, by diving into it, creates other routes, other possibilities, and, thanks to the receptivity generated by the open posture, it will activate all of our creativity in order to be able to act rather than react. \n\nIt will also, of course, create new causalities, other projections, other illusions because it is our lot as humans to produce thought, first of all with the language that must define, delimit, but if we remain in this movement of never grasping anything, then this sitting promises us from moment to moment the dynamic resilience of an interphenomenal self that adjusts itself infinitely. \n\nIf there is no longer an objective, if there is nothing to reach, to solve, to find, if our transformation no longer depends on us but on our capacity to become receptive, to let ourselves be in-formed rather than always seeking to transform ourselves, then a great relaxation takes place. \n\nFrom this relaxation, a new form of action different from our ordinary way emerges and the true power of action is activated as a result of this continuous deconstruction of our conditioned self. \n\nIt is in this that the posture is activism; contemplative activism.\n\nThe posture of the tenzo (the cook in Zen) is the dynamic expression of this space of inhibition of action in the direction that unfolds in all activities of our life. Its invitation brings us back into the flow of our daily life, bridging the gap between the sitting posture and the deep spirit of the posture that reveals itself in each of our movements. \n\nThe practice of tenzo offers us to dive into all the activities of our life in the relativity of our singularity, in the obligation that we have to choose, to decide to take charge while acting from the same space freed as that of the sitting. \n\nThis is why, to the reaction \"but we can't just sit!\", the response is that we don't just sit, because sitting in this context is first and foremost a dynamic posture that unfolds throughout our lives, in meditation as well as in the kitchen, and everywhere else as long as we set a direction.  \n\nTo explore this topic further join us in the Bergerac Praxis Hub this May. The spirit of posture is something fundamental to the Praxis Hub and will be particularly explored in the next Ouroboros residency (May 2023) in the context of internalized patriarchy.

I'm really privileged today to be joined by Jeffery Martin. Jeffery is a founder of the transformative technology space. He's a serial entrepreneur and a social scientist who researches personal transformation and the state of the greatest human wellbeing. And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call. And I really just want to welcome you to the podcast, Jeffery. So thank you for joining us.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 01:26\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 01:28\n\nYeah, and I thought we could maybe start, if you would just tell us a little bit about these key terms in your work, which is Fundamental Wellbeing or Persistent, Non-Symbolic Experience, which is a bit of a mouthful. Can you say a bit about what those are?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 01:46\n\nRight? Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 06:43\n\nSo in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 07:46\n\nAbsolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 10:27\n\nSo, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often. And as it says, Fundamental Wellbeing doesn't have to have this spiritual aspect, but it encompasses all those experiences, or as you said, awakening might be now becoming a more common term and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is the other term. So how did you come to this area? You know, can you tell me a bit about your life story? Where did you start and what led you to get interested in this?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 11:01\n\nAbsolutely. So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me. Back then I was still a hyper aggressive, hyper competitive type A type of person. And so really, what I did at that point was just set out to become the happiest person ever, right? I never set out to like, write books about this or anything like that. It was sort of like, I'm gonna win the happiness game like I'm gonna win every other game.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:07\n\nWhat job were you in at that time? What had you been doing? Like, what sort of work?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 13:12\n\nAt that point I was running companies and teaching. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:18\n\nWhat I mean, is were you working in wellbeing already? No, no, no. The companies spanned real estate, technology, media, those sectors. Speficially infromation technology, IT.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 13:39\n\nAdvertising for media. In the media, I'd moved on from like, you know, running TV stations or station groups or something like that to focusing on marketing, advertising, you know, where the money was, right?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:51\n\nWhere the money was. And so then you're like, okay, I'm going to win the happiness contetst, I'm now going to bring that energy. So what did you do next? How did you begin?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 14:03\n\nYeah, so I had had enough interaction over the years with academics, especially having done a lot of teaching in different environments, to realise that they were not going to be able to produce the truth. I knew I needed a research project that could produce, really, the truth, but I realised, in the academic world, the name of the game is basically grant chasing, right? And so, you know, they're gonna just basically try to get little incremental gains and publish little papers and suck as much money out of you as they can for as long as they possibly can, you know, because you're a new source of revenue for them basically. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 14:41\n\nThat was if you went and did grants or like commissioned research?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 14:44\n\nYeah, because I could have, right? I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody. And so I don't even have to really change my life.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 18:01\n\nWhen was this?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 18:07\n\nI think it started in 2006. And I found out about it like two weeks before it started and basically begged my way into the programme at the last minute. So I'm in this programme on transdisciplinary scholarship, and it is fantastic and it has a lot of Europeans in it teaching remotely because they don't actually have to be in San Francisco and all of that. And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right? Obviously, it didn't turn out that way. 17 years or 18 years later and here we are now.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 19:40\n\nFast forward a little bit. So you're working with Allan Combs, you're working at the California Institute for Integral Studies, and where did your investigation start? What did you actually start doing in your investigation? Once you've got your tools, what were you starting to investigate?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 20:05\n\nI was really just trying to find the happiest people out there. And I had an inkling, the reason Allan was interesting to me was because I've done some research before this, now I wasn't a scholar before this, right, I had masters degrees in management and stuff like that and technology and things. So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end. And so yeah, so that was the story.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 21:59\n\nSo to recap that, you'd already had this inkling, and it is an intriguing fact, that obviously there's this huge self help movement. And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do? \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 22:50\n\nYeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 27:05\n\nHow did you find them that to start with? How did what how did you find very happy people?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 27:13\n\nThat cost a lot of money, initially. Originally, I thought the main barrier to this project is that the people who could do it, who have an interest in it and who might be willing to do it on nights and weekends, basically believe that there's like six of these people in the world, at any given time and their odds of actually getting to them and researching them are non existent. And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was. So an established system, with well defined criteria, that groups of people that are, you know, reasonably knowledgeable on those criteria, could look at someone and say, that person is there. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 28:40\n\nSo what you were looking for, just to play this back and you explain it for listeners, what you were saying is to do good empirical research, you need a couple of things. So one is you're goning to need a way to then assess people, like to find out what was different about them, but then the toughest problem was actually finding a research population, or at least rigorous research, which was also having criteria for identifying people in Fundamental Wellbeing, that was not like fully objective, but at least there was like criteria and there was a community of practice that would kind of validate those criteria. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 29:19\n\nThose individuals specifically, not just the criteria, but the individuals as having met the criteria.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 29:27\n\nRight. Okay. So, you know, they've experienced in oneness or other behaviours, okay. So that was one thing, so you'd find a community probably, maybe a traditional religious one that has that, what were the other two?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 29:38\n\nNo, that was really sort of the heart of it, right, is that they had to have those three components: so it's an established tradition with rules and then people agreeing that a person fits the rules that are within the tradition and that are a valid enough group that could judge that. And that is basically the idea.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 30:03\n\nAnd then you said it was pretty expensive to find them, you said that was the most costly part. Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 37:10\n\nEmotion, that kind of thing. Yeah.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 37:12\n\nYeah. So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 37:36\n\nWell, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day. And so there were things like that, examples like that.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 41:48\n\nWow. Okay. And I think just also I want to flag this for ourselves and for listeners, what's amazing in a way about this, and it's so obvious, is we've moved from what would otherwise be very incomparable experiences, to things that start to be very noticeable, like a reduction in thoughts. What I'm also hearing is that often there was a strong before and after, there was strong changes that were noticeable around their waking up experiences. So I think that's really amazing. And at this point, how many people had you talked to at the end of this first phase?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 42:42\n\nThe first phase lasted for a number of years. In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east. We wanted to sample as broad a range of this as we could, in those early days, especially. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 44:34\n\nAnd I want to ask one other question on that, the other thing that intrigued me in looking at your work previously was that also you started to come across people who were not in any system, people who'd somehow, as it were, transitioned into Fundamental Wellbeing, and who weren't Christian, Buddhist or anything. When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 45:07\n\nYou know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 48:17\n\nSo just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 49:49\n\nWe didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research. And so that really held true for a very long time.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 54:12\n\nOkay, so at this point, this is, what five years into your project or something? \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 54:22\n\nSix, seven, a few years.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 54:25\n\nYeah, yeah. Because at some point, you've got enough data, and then I think we're coming towards the first Finders programme, I'd like to talk about that. You said you're interested in, when you mentioned these six people, you had this moment, like, maybe we can build a protocol that can help people actually transition to Fundamental Wellbeing. Is that right? Is that what I'm understanding from what you were just alluding to when you said about the book list? Could you say a bit about that?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 54:54\n\nYeah, basically, you know, the first few years we're doing all this interview stuff. So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there? And frankly we didn't.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 56:53\n\nThere being Fundamental Wellbeing? One thing, just to make it obvious for people on this call, you know, it may be obvious to you but I just want to flag, I might have in my life have seen some people who are just born happy; some people are just born lucky. Something that I assume you haven't mentioned, but you would have learnt from your first set of subjects, or people you talk to, was that they hadn't always been like this, or some of them maybe had been, but can I take that as one thing that we've almost said unsaid, that there have been times?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 57:01\n\nYeah, Fundamental Wellbeing, exactly.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 57:05\n\nYeah, for sure. There are a very tiny number of people who always seem to be in this. Like the thing that happens to the rest of us around age two and a half to three and a half doesn't happen to them and they just have spent their whole life in Fundamental Wellbeing, but that's a vanishingly small number of people. Okay. But so many people in your early interviews had reported some kind of transition or whatever, it had taken several experiences, but they had a real before and after. And that's the thing, I think, also is a really big insight, I know it comes out of many traditions, but what you want to flag is that Fundamental Wellbeing is both something that can kind of be, I don't want to say secularised, but you can see these criteria and things that really affect the quality of your life. and it is kind of this transition and often it's not gradual, I get from many of your people, it had been quite rapid at some point.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 58:27\n\nIt was about 70%, instant, 30% gradual in that early population of 1200 people, during those early years.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 58:35\n\nAnd for them, also, what you're getting is, it's kind of noticeable if it happens to you. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 58:39\n\nEven if it's gradual, you still realise. Interestingly, you can not notice it initially, because you have such a drop off and self reflective block, right? And after the transition, you're not like constantly analysing what's going on with you, or whether you're happy or whether someone likes the blue jacket that I'm wearing, or, you know, all of that neuroticism just sort of goes away. So, you actually kind of miss that you've transitioned to this. And even like super famous people told us like, you know, they didn't notice it sometimes for weeks or months afterward, and then they'd be like, you know, pontificating on it in some, you know, religious environment where they were considered an expert on it, even though they hadn't gotten there yet, but they were like, some senior teacher or something, right. And they're like, checking off in their mind the boxes, and at some point, they're like, Oh, I wonder when that happened? So it's kind of a funny aside.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 59:34\n\nThat is very funny. So yeah, people could not notice. And to come back then, you were then starting to look, if we want to understand more about what's going on, we really would like to find situations where people actually transition. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 59:51\n\nAnd measure them before and after. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 59:53\n\nAnd I'm almost hearing that you came up with the protocol or a way of trying to support people doing that, because otherwise, you'd have to like be with lots of people and like most of them wouldn't transition, and there's no kind of predictable way. And that's one of the things I want to ask about because you could be like, oh, wouldn't it be easy? Why wouldn't you just go to some of these gurus and say, like, just find me some of your students, surely some of them are going to wake up in the next few months. One of the things that you'd maybe been seeing was that that wasn't generally the case, that people reliably transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing, even in these spiritual traditions, it was a bit more random, even there, is that right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:00:32\n\nAlmost nobody transitioned, you know, and we had really well known spiritual teachers, when we would ask for a referral to some of their students to participate in the research, who would confide in us that they're not sure anybody ever woke up from, you know, their teachings, we learned that this was considered one of the most frustrating professions out there, if you weren't in Fundamental Wellbeing, it's hard to imagine that you could keep doing this day in and day out, because it was just, you know, having very little actual impact in terms of the transition to fundamental well being on people. And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number. And he's like, as far as I know, no one has ever transitioned that I've worked with, he's like, you know, what can you tell me about what I can do differently? And I'm like, well, I can tell you that's normal. You're in good company, you know, your competitors in the spiritual space aren't like, you know, really lapping you on this one, right. And we had a great conversation about it. I mean, these types of conversations were not uncommon, you know. And so the problem for us in that when wanting to measure people before and after was, despite our global reach at this point, there wasn't any place that we could think to go, where it had, you know, enough of a hit rate, to justify paying for them to be in a scanner beforehand and then, you know, just having thrown away that 700 bucks, or whatever it would have cost, you know, for the scanner time,\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:02:38\n\nI do just want to flag this Jeffery because I think also for listeners, for those interested, you know, obviously, you could pick up a book, I could pick an example, like Culadasa's book, which people might know, The Mind Illuminated, a classic guide to at least Buddhist meditation. And at the beginning it's kind of like, look, if you really do this, well, the Dalai Lama reckons you could do this in a year. There is this tendency to be like, just do the meditations right in this particular practice. So I just want to flag this point, which is that that insight is quite significant, I think, and I think this may have to run into a second interview, potentially, but even at this point, I want to come to it, that is a really significant point, because there is a tendency in a lot of the teaching of a tradition lik just do the meditation practices right and, you know, in like a year, you know, you should be able to get to level 10. There's an incredible frustration that you often don't, and maybe a surprise that also things aren't highly effective. And I think there's also the tendency that it is so amazing when it does occur for people, they're just like, well I was just doing that if you just do that particular mantra, or you do this particular thing, or just do this extreme sport, and, you know, whatever it is, there's a tendency to perhaps extrapolate, over extrapolate from one's own experience, particularly also once when in Fundamental Wellbeing I think there's a haziness about the prior period of the journey. You  came to this because you were looking to look at before and after.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:04:30\n\nThe thing to think about with this, right, is that in most Eastern traditions, that's okay. And in Western traditions, to some degree too, in Western traditions, you just sort of generally have to be right with God to get to the right heaven, right. And so if you don't actually have a mystical union experience with it, but you're, you know, you're pious and devout or whatever, that's an okay way to spend your life. On the eastern side, you've always got more lifetimes, right? And so there isn't really an expectation of a lot of success on the Eastern tradition side of thinks, right? So it's only in sort of like a new non dualish sort of guy like the one that I gave an example of that they're bothered by this, you know. If you're steeped in Hinduism or Buddhism, it's just sort of like, well, of course, nobody's making that much progress because you make progress over 1000s of lifetimes. So I think you do have to put that frame, it's not like there's some ethical problem for them, like, you know, they're out there saying this, and it's not producing the result, they're assuming it's going to produce results over many lifetimes. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:04:30\n\nYes, there's even a sense, I think, in many traditions, we have to be careful here, that it can be like kind of grasping after things, it can become like another thing on the list like, I think you jokingly referred to yourself at the beginning like, you know, I aced everything else now I'm going to ace well being. And obviously, there's this kind of subtilty, but to come to it then, you were coming to look at it before and after. The protocol, what brought you towards like looking at creating a structure to support people in transition?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:06:09\n\nWe just wanted to collect AB data, you know, we just wanted to collect before and after data, that was our only real impetus.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:06:16\n\nSo what happened? So tell me a bit, you found six people from your list? And what was it you created? Tell us a bit about this.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:06:23\n\nWe tried a whole bunch of stuff, you know, beforehand, before the six people, long before those six people, we tried all sorts of brain zapping methods, things like that. That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods. So let's say there's like half a dozen general categories of methods, we have since collapsed that down to five categories of methods, but at the time it was like half a dozen categories of methods.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:08:42\n\nFor listeners, just what do you mean by method?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:08:45\n\nSo, you know, for instance, it might be a meditation method, like a mantra-based method, right? We've learned that, you know, most mantra-based methods don't transition people, there's, you know, some subsets of some very specific types of mantra methods that do. And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:09:43\n\nSo just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods. And then the point, which you said, I think is also a really big insight for listeners, and anyone interested, and obviously you can find more in Jeffery's work and the course 45 days to awakening, which I highly recommend. But the basic point was that you have good methods, but any given method only works for certain people, that's what you mean by matching, is that right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:10:20\n\nExactly, exactly. And so, it's not enough to have a list, with instructions even from the best form of these gold standard type of methods that are most likely to work on a small percentage of people, let's say 3% of people, or 4% of people, I mean, if you've got a method that works on 3 or 4%, of people reliably, you've invented one of the best methods ever, you know, that is an enormously successful method and hit rate. Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:12:55\n\nJust for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:13:07\n\nA four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:13:10\n\nYeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before. And that's extraordinary, that is extraordinary results.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:13:29\n\nYeah, it is. To us it's just so routine now that you know, at the time, it was like, this is incredible, you know, but now it's sort of like, it's normal.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:13:37\n\nI got that and there are many other things like how can more people do it, but what I just want to say on that point, and I think that's what we could delve into in a follow up, I hope, with this, Jeffrey, and I want to get a moment to thank you, but I want to leave you and listneners with the question, what's amazing for me is that we got to do this in this way, that this journey of empiricism can be useful, open minded empiricism can be really, really valuable. And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much.

And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call.

Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 06:43\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 07:46\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Absolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 10:27\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often.

So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me. Back then I was still a hyper aggressive, hyper competitive type A type of person. And so really, what I did at that point was just set out to become the happiest person ever, right? I never set out to like, write books about this or anything like that.

I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody. And so I don't even have to really change my life.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 18:01\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"When was this?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 18:07\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I think it started in 2006.

So I'm in this programme on transdisciplinary scholarship, and it is fantastic and it has a lot of Europeans in it teaching remotely because they don't actually have to be in San Francisco and all of that. And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right?

And I had an inkling, the reason Allan was interesting to me was because I've done some research before this, now I wasn't a scholar before this, right, I had masters degrees in management and stuff like that and technology and things. So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end.

And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 22:50\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 27:05\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How did you find them that to start with?

And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was.

Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 37:10\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Emotion, that kind of thing.

So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 37:36\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`Well, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day. And so there were things like that, examples like that.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 41:48\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Wow. Okay.

What I'm also hearing is that often there was a strong before and after, there was strong changes that were noticeable around their waking up experiences. So I think that's really amazing.

In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east.

When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 45:07\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`You know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 48:17\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 49:49\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research.

So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there?

And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number.

So it's only in sort of like a new non dualish sort of guy like the one that I gave an example of that they're bothered by this, you know. If you're steeped in Hinduism or Buddhism, it's just sort of like, well, of course, nobody's making that much progress because you make progress over 1000s of lifetimes. So I think you do have to put that frame, it's not like there's some ethical problem for them, like, you know, they're out there saying this, and it's not producing the result, they're assuming it's going to produce results over many lifetimes.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:04:30\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yes, there's even a sense, I think, in many traditions, we have to be careful here, that it can be like kind of grasping after things, it can become like another thing on the list like, I think you jokingly referred to yourself at the beginning like, you know, I aced everything else now I'm going to ace well being. And obviously, there's this kind of subtilty, but to come to it then, you were coming to look at it before and after. The protocol, what brought you towards like looking at creating a structure to support people in transition?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 1:06:09\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We just wanted to collect AB data, you know, we just wanted to collect before and after data, that was our only real impetus.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:06:16\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So what happened?

That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods. So let's say there's like half a dozen general categories of methods, we have since collapsed that down to five categories of methods, but at the time it was like half a dozen categories of methods.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:08:42\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"For listeners, just what do you mean by method?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 1:08:45\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So, you know, for instance, it might be a meditation method, like a mantra-based method, right? We've learned that, you know, most mantra-based methods don't transition people, there's, you know, some subsets of some very specific types of mantra methods that do. And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:09:43\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods. And then the point, which you said, I think is also a really big insight for listeners, and anyone interested, and obviously you can find more in Jeffery's work and the course 45 days to awakening, which I highly recommend. But the basic point was that you have good methods, but any given method only works for certain people, that's what you mean by matching, is that right?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 1:10:20\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Exactly, exactly. And so, it's not enough to have a list, with instructions even from the best form of these gold standard type of methods that are most likely to work on a small percentage of people, let's say 3% of people, or 4% of people, I mean, if you've got a method that works on 3 or 4%, of people reliably, you've invented one of the best methods ever, you know, that is an enormously successful method and hit rate. Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:12:55\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Just for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 1:13:07\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"A four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:13:10\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before.

And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much.

I'm really privileged today to be joined by Jeffery Martin. Jeffery is a founder of the transformative technology space. He's a serial entrepreneur and a social scientist who researches personal transformation and the state of the greatest human wellbeing. And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call. And I really just want to welcome you to the podcast, Jeffery. So thank you for joining us.\n\nJeffery Martin 01:26\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nRufus Pollock 01:28\n\nYeah, and I thought we could maybe start, if you would just tell us a little bit about these key terms in your work, which is Fundamental Wellbeing or Persistent, Non-Symbolic Experience, which is a bit of a mouthful. Can you say a bit about what those are?\n\nJeffery Martin 01:46\n\nRight? Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\n\nRufus Pollock 06:43\n\nSo in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\n\nJeffery Martin 07:46\n\nAbsolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\n\nRufus Pollock 10:27\n\nSo, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often. And as it says, Fundamental Wellbeing doesn't have to have this spiritual aspect, but it encompasses all those experiences, or as you said, awakening might be now becoming a more common term and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is the other term. So how did you come to this area? You know, can you tell me a bit about your life story? Where did you start and what led you to get interested in this?\n\nJeffery Martin 11:01\n\nAbsolutely. So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me. Back then I was still a hyper aggressive, hyper competitive type A type of person. And so really, what I did at that point was just set out to become the happiest person ever, right? I never set out to like, write books about this or anything like that. It was sort of like, I'm gonna win the happiness game like I'm gonna win every other game.\n\nRufus Pollock 13:07\n\nWhat job were you in at that time? What had you been doing? Like, what sort of work?\n\nJeffery Martin 13:12\n\nAt that point I was running companies and teaching. \n\nRufus Pollock 13:18\n\nWhat I mean, is were you working in wellbeing already? No, no, no. The companies spanned real estate, technology, media, those sectors. Speficially infromation technology, IT.\n\nJeffery Martin 13:39\n\nAdvertising for media. In the media, I'd moved on from like, you know, running TV stations or station groups or something like that to focusing on marketing, advertising, you know, where the money was, right?\n\nRufus Pollock 13:51\n\nWhere the money was. And so then you're like, okay, I'm going to win the happiness contetst, I'm now going to bring that energy. So what did you do next? How did you begin?\n\nJeffery Martin 14:03\n\nYeah, so I had had enough interaction over the years with academics, especially having done a lot of teaching in different environments, to realise that they were not going to be able to produce the truth. I knew I needed a research project that could produce, really, the truth, but I realised, in the academic world, the name of the game is basically grant chasing, right? And so, you know, they're gonna just basically try to get little incremental gains and publish little papers and suck as much money out of you as they can for as long as they possibly can, you know, because you're a new source of revenue for them basically. \n\nRufus Pollock 14:41\n\nThat was if you went and did grants or like commissioned research?\n\nJeffery Martin 14:44\n\nYeah, because I could have, right? I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody. And so I don't even have to really change my life.\n\nRufus Pollock 18:01\n\nWhen was this?\n\nJeffery Martin 18:07\n\nI think it started in 2006. And I found out about it like two weeks before it started and basically begged my way into the programme at the last minute. So I'm in this programme on transdisciplinary scholarship, and it is fantastic and it has a lot of Europeans in it teaching remotely because they don't actually have to be in San Francisco and all of that. And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right? Obviously, it didn't turn out that way. 17 years or 18 years later and here we are now.\n\nRufus Pollock 19:40\n\nFast forward a little bit. So you're working with Allan Combs, you're working at the California Institute for Integral Studies, and where did your investigation start? What did you actually start doing in your investigation? Once you've got your tools, what were you starting to investigate?\n\nJeffery Martin 20:05\n\nI was really just trying to find the happiest people out there. And I had an inkling, the reason Allan was interesting to me was because I've done some research before this, now I wasn't a scholar before this, right, I had masters degrees in management and stuff like that and technology and things. So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end. And so yeah, so that was the story.\n\nRufus Pollock 21:59\n\nSo to recap that, you'd already had this inkling, and it is an intriguing fact, that obviously there's this huge self help movement. And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do? \n\nJeffery Martin 22:50\n\nYeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\n\nRufus Pollock 27:05\n\nHow did you find them that to start with? How did what how did you find very happy people?\n\nJeffery Martin 27:13\n\nThat cost a lot of money, initially. Originally, I thought the main barrier to this project is that the people who could do it, who have an interest in it and who might be willing to do it on nights and weekends, basically believe that there's like six of these people in the world, at any given time and their odds of actually getting to them and researching them are non existent. And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was. So an established system, with well defined criteria, that groups of people that are, you know, reasonably knowledgeable on those criteria, could look at someone and say, that person is there. \n\nRufus Pollock 28:40\n\nSo what you were looking for, just to play this back and you explain it for listeners, what you were saying is to do good empirical research, you need a couple of things. So one is you're goning to need a way to then assess people, like to find out what was different about them, but then the toughest problem was actually finding a research population, or at least rigorous research, which was also having criteria for identifying people in Fundamental Wellbeing, that was not like fully objective, but at least there was like criteria and there was a community of practice that would kind of validate those criteria. \n\nJeffery Martin 29:19\n\nThose individuals specifically, not just the criteria, but the individuals as having met the criteria.\n\nRufus Pollock 29:27\n\nRight. Okay. So, you know, they've experienced in oneness or other behaviours, okay. So that was one thing, so you'd find a community probably, maybe a traditional religious one that has that, what were the other two?\n\nJeffery Martin 29:38\n\nNo, that was really sort of the heart of it, right, is that they had to have those three components: so it's an established tradition with rules and then people agreeing that a person fits the rules that are within the tradition and that are a valid enough group that could judge that. And that is basically the idea.\n\nRufus Pollock 30:03\n\nAnd then you said it was pretty expensive to find them, you said that was the most costly part. Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\n\nJeffery Martin 37:10\n\nEmotion, that kind of thing. Yeah.\n\nRufus Pollock 37:12\n\nYeah. So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\n\nJeffery Martin 37:36\n\nWell, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day. And so there were things like that, examples like that.\n\nRufus Pollock 41:48\n\nWow. Okay. And I think just also I want to flag this for ourselves and for listeners, what's amazing in a way about this, and it's so obvious, is we've moved from what would otherwise be very incomparable experiences, to things that start to be very noticeable, like a reduction in thoughts. What I'm also hearing is that often there was a strong before and after, there was strong changes that were noticeable around their waking up experiences. So I think that's really amazing. And at this point, how many people had you talked to at the end of this first phase?\n\nJeffery Martin 42:42\n\nThe first phase lasted for a number of years. In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east. We wanted to sample as broad a range of this as we could, in those early days, especially. \n\nRufus Pollock 44:34\n\nAnd I want to ask one other question on that, the other thing that intrigued me in looking at your work previously was that also you started to come across people who were not in any system, people who'd somehow, as it were, transitioned into Fundamental Wellbeing, and who weren't Christian, Buddhist or anything. When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\n\nJeffery Martin 45:07\n\nYou know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.\n\nRufus Pollock 48:17\n\nSo just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\n\nJeffery Martin 49:49\n\nWe didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research. And so that really held true for a very long time.\n\nRufus Pollock 54:12\n\nOkay, so at this point, this is, what five years into your project or something? \n\nJeffery Martin 54:22\n\nSix, seven, a few years.\n\nRufus Pollock 54:25\n\nYeah, yeah. Because at some point, you've got enough data, and then I think we're coming towards the first Finders programme, I'd like to talk about that. You said you're interested in, when you mentioned these six people, you had this moment, like, maybe we can build a protocol that can help people actually transition to Fundamental Wellbeing. Is that right? Is that what I'm understanding from what you were just alluding to when you said about the book list? Could you say a bit about that?\n\nJeffery Martin 54:54\n\nYeah, basically, you know, the first few years we're doing all this interview stuff. So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there? And frankly we didn't.\n\nRufus Pollock 56:53\n\nThere being Fundamental Wellbeing? One thing, just to make it obvious for people on this call, you know, it may be obvious to you but I just want to flag, I might have in my life have seen some people who are just born happy; some people are just born lucky. Something that I assume you haven't mentioned, but you would have learnt from your first set of subjects, or people you talk to, was that they hadn't always been like this, or some of them maybe had been, but can I take that as one thing that we've almost said unsaid, that there have been times?\n\nJeffery Martin 57:01\n\nYeah, Fundamental Wellbeing, exactly.\n\nRufus Pollock 57:05\n\nYeah, for sure. There are a very tiny number of people who always seem to be in this. Like the thing that happens to the rest of us around age two and a half to three and a half doesn't happen to them and they just have spent their whole life in Fundamental Wellbeing, but that's a vanishingly small number of people. Okay. But so many people in your early interviews had reported some kind of transition or whatever, it had taken several experiences, but they had a real before and after. And that's the thing, I think, also is a really big insight, I know it comes out of many traditions, but what you want to flag is that Fundamental Wellbeing is both something that can kind of be, I don't want to say secularised, but you can see these criteria and things that really affect the quality of your life. and it is kind of this transition and often it's not gradual, I get from many of your people, it had been quite rapid at some point.\n\nJeffery Martin 58:27\n\nIt was about 70%, instant, 30% gradual in that early population of 1200 people, during those early years.\n\nRufus Pollock 58:35\n\nAnd for them, also, what you're getting is, it's kind of noticeable if it happens to you. \n\nJeffery Martin 58:39\n\nEven if it's gradual, you still realise. Interestingly, you can not notice it initially, because you have such a drop off and self reflective block, right? And after the transition, you're not like constantly analysing what's going on with you, or whether you're happy or whether someone likes the blue jacket that I'm wearing, or, you know, all of that neuroticism just sort of goes away. So, you actually kind of miss that you've transitioned to this. And even like super famous people told us like, you know, they didn't notice it sometimes for weeks or months afterward, and then they'd be like, you know, pontificating on it in some, you know, religious environment where they were considered an expert on it, even though they hadn't gotten there yet, but they were like, some senior teacher or something, right. And they're like, checking off in their mind the boxes, and at some point, they're like, Oh, I wonder when that happened? So it's kind of a funny aside.\n\nRufus Pollock 59:34\n\nThat is very funny. So yeah, people could not notice. And to come back then, you were then starting to look, if we want to understand more about what's going on, we really would like to find situations where people actually transition. \n\nJeffery Martin 59:51\n\nAnd measure them before and after. \n\nRufus Pollock 59:53\n\nAnd I'm almost hearing that you came up with the protocol or a way of trying to support people doing that, because otherwise, you'd have to like be with lots of people and like most of them wouldn't transition, and there's no kind of predictable way. And that's one of the things I want to ask about because you could be like, oh, wouldn't it be easy? Why wouldn't you just go to some of these gurus and say, like, just find me some of your students, surely some of them are going to wake up in the next few months. One of the things that you'd maybe been seeing was that that wasn't generally the case, that people reliably transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing, even in these spiritual traditions, it was a bit more random, even there, is that right?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:00:32\n\nAlmost nobody transitioned, you know, and we had really well known spiritual teachers, when we would ask for a referral to some of their students to participate in the research, who would confide in us that they're not sure anybody ever woke up from, you know, their teachings, we learned that this was considered one of the most frustrating professions out there, if you weren't in Fundamental Wellbeing, it's hard to imagine that you could keep doing this day in and day out, because it was just, you know, having very little actual impact in terms of the transition to fundamental well being on people. And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number. And he's like, as far as I know, no one has ever transitioned that I've worked with, he's like, you know, what can you tell me about what I can do differently? And I'm like, well, I can tell you that's normal. You're in good company, you know, your competitors in the spiritual space aren't like, you know, really lapping you on this one, right. And we had a great conversation about it. I mean, these types of conversations were not uncommon, you know. And so the problem for us in that when wanting to measure people before and after was, despite our global reach at this point, there wasn't any place that we could think to go, where it had, you know, enough of a hit rate, to justify paying for them to be in a scanner beforehand and then, you know, just having thrown away that 700 bucks, or whatever it would have cost, you know, for the scanner time,\n\nRufus Pollock 1:02:38\n\nI do just want to flag this Jeffery because I think also for listeners, for those interested, you know, obviously, you could pick up a book, I could pick an example, like Culadasa's book, which people might know, The Mind Illuminated, a classic guide to at least Buddhist meditation. And at the beginning it's kind of like, look, if you really do this, well, the Dalai Lama reckons you could do this in a year. There is this tendency to be like, just do the meditations right in this particular practice. So I just want to flag this point, which is that that insight is quite significant, I think, and I think this may have to run into a second interview, potentially, but even at this point, I want to come to it, that is a really significant point, because there is a tendency in a lot of the teaching of a tradition lik just do the meditation practices right and, you know, in like a year, you know, you should be able to get to level 10. There's an incredible frustration that you often don't, and maybe a surprise that also things aren't highly effective. And I think there's also the tendency that it is so amazing when it does occur for people, they're just like, well I was just doing that if you just do that particular mantra, or you do this particular thing, or just do this extreme sport, and, you know, whatever it is, there's a tendency to perhaps extrapolate, over extrapolate from one's own experience, particularly also once when in Fundamental Wellbeing I think there's a haziness about the prior period of the journey. You  came to this because you were looking to look at before and after.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:04:30\n\nThe thing to think about with this, right, is that in most Eastern traditions, that's okay. And in Western traditions, to some degree too, in Western traditions, you just sort of generally have to be right with God to get to the right heaven, right. And so if you don't actually have a mystical union experience with it, but you're, you know, you're pious and devout or whatever, that's an okay way to spend your life. On the eastern side, you've always got more lifetimes, right? And so there isn't really an expectation of a lot of success on the Eastern tradition side of thinks, right? So it's only in sort of like a new non dualish sort of guy like the one that I gave an example of that they're bothered by this, you know. If you're steeped in Hinduism or Buddhism, it's just sort of like, well, of course, nobody's making that much progress because you make progress over 1000s of lifetimes. So I think you do have to put that frame, it's not like there's some ethical problem for them, like, you know, they're out there saying this, and it's not producing the result, they're assuming it's going to produce results over many lifetimes. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:04:30\n\nYes, there's even a sense, I think, in many traditions, we have to be careful here, that it can be like kind of grasping after things, it can become like another thing on the list like, I think you jokingly referred to yourself at the beginning like, you know, I aced everything else now I'm going to ace well being. And obviously, there's this kind of subtilty, but to come to it then, you were coming to look at it before and after. The protocol, what brought you towards like looking at creating a structure to support people in transition?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:06:09\n\nWe just wanted to collect AB data, you know, we just wanted to collect before and after data, that was our only real impetus.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:06:16\n\nSo what happened? So tell me a bit, you found six people from your list? And what was it you created? Tell us a bit about this.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:06:23\n\nWe tried a whole bunch of stuff, you know, beforehand, before the six people, long before those six people, we tried all sorts of brain zapping methods, things like that. That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods. So let's say there's like half a dozen general categories of methods, we have since collapsed that down to five categories of methods, but at the time it was like half a dozen categories of methods.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:08:42\n\nFor listeners, just what do you mean by method?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:08:45\n\nSo, you know, for instance, it might be a meditation method, like a mantra-based method, right? We've learned that, you know, most mantra-based methods don't transition people, there's, you know, some subsets of some very specific types of mantra methods that do. And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:09:43\n\nSo just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods. And then the point, which you said, I think is also a really big insight for listeners, and anyone interested, and obviously you can find more in Jeffery's work and the course 45 days to awakening, which I highly recommend. But the basic point was that you have good methods, but any given method only works for certain people, that's what you mean by matching, is that right?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:10:20\n\nExactly, exactly. And so, it's not enough to have a list, with instructions even from the best form of these gold standard type of methods that are most likely to work on a small percentage of people, let's say 3% of people, or 4% of people, I mean, if you've got a method that works on 3 or 4%, of people reliably, you've invented one of the best methods ever, you know, that is an enormously successful method and hit rate. Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:12:55\n\nJust for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\n\nJeffery Martin 1:13:07\n\nA four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:13:10\n\nYeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before. And that's extraordinary, that is extraordinary results.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:13:29\n\nYeah, it is. To us it's just so routine now that you know, at the time, it was like, this is incredible, you know, but now it's sort of like, it's normal.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:13:37\n\nI got that and there are many other things like how can more people do it, but what I just want to say on that point, and I think that's what we could delve into in a follow up, I hope, with this, Jeffrey, and I want to get a moment to thank you, but I want to leave you and listneners with the question, what's amazing for me is that we got to do this in this way, that this journey of empiricism can be useful, open minded empiricism can be really, really valuable. And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\n\n"}],"keyWritings":[{"title":"Cultivating an Emerging Paradigm","image":"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-27.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"rufuspollock","name":"Rufus Pollock","avatar":"/assets/images/Rufus-Pollock-684x684-1.png","body":{"raw":"\nRufus Pollock is a Founder of Open Knowledge, an award-winning international digital non-profit.

We’d like to thank Theo Cox of Life Itself for his support in editing it._\n\n## Introduction\n\nThrough our discussions, we noticed our thinking and work has a very similar perspective on the approach to social transformation – one linking the inner and the outer, the personal and the collective. We drafted this mini-essay initially simply to set out concretely our shared views, approach and strategy.  \n\nWe have chosen to share it more widely for a few reasons. First, we think that others may find the overall summary resonates with them and connects with their thinking and approach – especially the more general context and challenge sections. Second,  we would like to gather feedback and generate discussion around its content and thesis. Third, it could be an illustration for how other people and organizations create deeper alignment – this material was worked out over several sessions spanning several months.  \n\nFinally, we emphasize that this is but one of many ways to understand our current context and how to respond to it. We would very much like to hear from others who feel alignment or tension with what we have written. You can reach us via various channels, the best being [https://lifeitself.org/contact/](https://lifeitself.org/contact/).\n\n## **Summary**\n\nOur key theses are:\n\n**1\\. Transition is Needed**: there is an urgent need for a transition from where things stand today.\n\n**2\\. Transition is Paradigmatic**: The transition involves a paradigmatic shift that includes a profound shift in worldview (views and values).\n\n**3\\. Transition is Inner \u0026 Outer**:  the transition involves the integration of the inner and the outer – personal/collective growth as well as systemic transformation.\n\n**4\\. Transition prioritizes Being:** whilst inner and outer are both needed, inner development has primacy, that is it should be prioritized and takes ultimate priority (also known as the [“primacy of being” thesis](https://lifeitself.org/primacy-of-being/)).\n\n**5\\. Transition requires Engagement (of the right kind):** transition can be cultivated but not engineered. There is a middle way between passive disengagement (just letting it unfold) and arrogant engineering. The challenge is therefore to facilitate transition and cultivate emergence, rather than seeking to engineer it. \n\n## Context\n\nHumanity and the planet are at a critical point in history similar to major breakdown/breakthrough points of the past, most recently the transition to modernity in the Enlightenment. We risk civilizational collapse and we also have the possibility of a breakthrough.\n\nThis transition cannot be “managed” or “engineered” but it can be facilitated and supported. In this vein, we have a sense of what the upwards transition would look and feel like:\n\nA.  Involve a focus on inner development i.e. the left quadrants in [Ken Wilber’s quadrant model](https://lifeitself.org/2019/01/22/ken-wilber-integral-spirituality/). Quadrants are a reference to [Ken Wilber’s quadrant model](https://lifeitself.org/2019/01/22/ken-wilber-integral-spirituality/) matrixing inner and outer, singular and plural. We prioritize the \"inner\" left quadrants for two reasons. First, because they have been relatively neglected compared to the right quadrants in recent periods such as modernity (\"our technological powers have outstripped our wisdom to use them\"). This is not because the left quadrants are more important per se. Second, intellectual knowledge is easier to transmit than implicit knowledge - i.e. more mimetically fit. Thus, the inner may require more conscious effort and attention -- if not an imbalance between our inner and outer development will simply reflect the ease of transmission rather than any intentional neglect. For more on this latter point see  [https://lifeitself.org/2017/09/10/four-types-of-problem/](https://lifeitself.org/2017/09/10/four-types-of-problem/)  e.g. \"And \\[progress on being\\] requires conscious skilful effort and is not easily replicable – just because I get enlightened does not mean you do. But if I invent a better way to grow corn you can easily copy it.\" This is a thesis we term the “[primacy of being](https://lifeitself.org/primacy-of-being/).”\n\nB.  An increasing capacity to relate to oneself, to others, to society, and to the planet in deeper and richer ways from a space of greater awareness and (inner) freedom.\n\nIn terms of where we are in the trajectory of breakthrough - or collapse - we have the following, very crude, guesstimates:\n\nFirst, there is a rapidly growing set of people who sense that things are wrong. That something is not working with the current paradigm – even if they might not frame it that way. We conjecture ~20%+ in places like Europe and North America. \n\nSecond, there is a much smaller subset of those who are not cynical or depressed and therefore potentially active. We hypothesize this group to be around ~2% of the population in a leading edge location e.g. Stockholm. \n\nThird, and finally, within that there is a subset who appreciate the above and are potential pioneers/facilitators of the next stage. This group is currently very small. Our wild speculation is that this is less than one in a thousand (0.1%) in leading edge locations.\n\nWe consider these groups roughly to map onto Fisher’s Personal Transition Curve, shown below.\n\n![](/assets/images/image_2022-08-01_152040395.png)\n\n## Challenge\n\nFirst, without an upward transition, there is a high probability of a downward one, i.e. civilizational collapse. This would be a bad outcome in a great many waysFor those who are sanguine about humanity’s disappearance or view an over-concern as anthropocentric (e.g. “we are a cancer and the ecosystem would be better without us … etc”) it is worth noting that our downfall will hurt all living beings. We will fall because the ecosystem collapses, which will obviously be bad for the ecosystem. Plus the risk of extinction of humanity is not “good” because this represents (at least to our knowledge) a pinnacle of complexity so far – e.g. first example of self-awareness etc. Thus, we want an upwards transition.\n\nSecond, incremental patching of the old system is insufficient. these issues are foundational and go to the root of the existing paradigm at both a socio-economic and, more importantly, at a cultural and ontological level – the level of worldview and being.\n\nThird, simply “stepping back” and disengaging from our current situation is insufficient too. It is essential to have active engagement and support for a transition.\n\nThis must not be approached as “fixing” the problem, or come from the same arrogant engineering mindset which has led us to crisis in the first place – but it is also insufficient just to “step back and let the evolutionary process unfold”.\n\nInstead, we can focus on creating and shaping the conditions for emergence, through a combination of sense-making faculties that allow us both to attune and relate in a new way as well as to be in service to that which is unfolding.\n\nMetaphorically, we are gardeners, facilitators and improvisers rather than engineers or scientists. Moreover, it is an unavoidable reality that we are a key part of the evolutionary process and not apart from. Our choice is not to play a role or not but whether to be _conscious_ or _unconscious_ participants in the process. Being conscious seems not only wiser but also a responsibility. \n\nFourth, and finally, these views have not spread much, especially to the mainstream – that is, the views of the need for transition, its paradigmatic nature, and the need for engagement. Whilst there are “pioneers” (early adopters) they are still a tiny minority, un-networked; and lacking a common language.\n\n**In short, there is as yet no self-conscious “movement”**. So much so, we don’t even know how many there are, and what terminology to use. **Moreover, many who are, or could be part of this, don’t yet recognize each other**. At a practical level, there is much that is needed, including:\n\n1. common, concrete principles, manifestos and frameworks\n2. research and practice agendas\n3. resourcing, especially in terms of funders or academic support\n4. knowledge and working examples of how to catalyse transformation in persons and groups, and\n5. mainstream awareness and recognition \n\nWe emphasize that there are, of course, existing initiatives that, for example, seek to map the ecosystem and connect actors and activities or seek to create frameworks for a meta-network. However, most are very early stage and we need to find ways to do so at scale.\n\n## Question\n\nThis brings us to the key questions we seek to answer which are the following:\n\n- Where are we in the process of bifurcation and emergence?\n- What hypotheses do we have as to what will facilitate transition/emergence upwards?\n- And, finally, based on that, what would be a near-term roadmap e.g. for the next 5 years?\n\nBelow we have included the issue tree generated from the above question. The diagram breaks down the sub-questions we have to answer in order to generate an adequate response to the main question.\n\n![](/assets/images/image_2022-08-01_152115143-1024x769.png)\n\n## Thesis\n\nWe are at a very early stage in the [Berkana](https://berkana.org/resources/pioneering-a-new-paradigm/)[two loop model](https://www.systemsinnovation.io/post/two-loop-model) with a few scattered people who really feel the necessary direction of change, within a larger set who are starting to sense something. \n\n![](/assets/images/image_2022-08-01_152151026.png)\n\nOne can set out in detail the plausible steps in a transition and the emergence of a new paradigm and where we are within it. Here is sufficient to say that we think pioneer groups are starting to connect and define key terms and framework for a global movement made of small localized communities, globally connected.\n\nGiven where we are in this process right now, we think in the nearer term (3-5-10 years) we should focus on connecting these pioneer groups, while starting to cocreate key terms and a framework for a global movement made of these small localized communities which are globally connected.\n\nRight now, a key priority is identifying other parties and aligning core initial activities, e.g. developing a shared language, research agenda, experiments in community building and so on. A start has been made in this [ecosystem mapping project](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/).\n\nOver the next 5 years we are going to start discovery and alignment workshops via snowball referrals in the field. Through these and related efforts we hope to identify key stakeholders and potential strategic partners, and map and connect the ecosystem in a way that supports its evolution and impact on wider society\n\nAs inner development is so crucial to this transition, a major focus will be on practices and spaces to cultivate and nurture sustained evolution. To this end, we will work with others to develop deliberately developmental programs, spaces and communities.\n\nRelatedly, we will experiment with a broader range of offers as a way of engagement and finding potential pioneers (e.g. inner development goals, personal development workshops).\n\nWe will leverage academic methods and wisdom traditions to inform our approach, exploring various schools of thought and using academics’ knowledge of emerging communities of practice. We can also leverage consulting communities and other professional contacts for connections into the business world.\n\nFinally, it will be important to keep our eyes on the horizon and to imagine various longer-term scenarios (e.g. 30y and beyond) and how they would start to show up. We don’t know yet how these efforts will unfold, both direction and speed, and any signs will help us better to direct and adapt our efforts – just as a gardener nurturing a new and unknown shoot will keep their eyes out for any hint as to its ultimate nature so as to support it with the right nutrients and care as well as to notice early signs of disease or ill-health.\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var u=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(t,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||t((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(t,e)=\u003e{for(var i in e)o(t,i,{get:e[i],enumerable:!0})},s=(t,e,i,r)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of g(e))!m.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026a!==i\u0026\u0026o(t,a,{get:()=\u003ee[a],enumerable:!(r=p(e,a))||r.enumerable});return t};var y=(t,e,i)=\u003e(i=t!=null?c(u(t)):{},s(e||!t||!t.__esModule?o(i,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):i,t)),v=t=\u003es(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var h=w((H,l)=\u003e{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var T={};f(T,{default:()=\u003ex,frontmatter:()=\u003eb});var n=y(h()),b={title:\"Cultivating an Emerging Paradigm\",created:new Date(16436736e5),categories:[\"life-itself\",\"our-philosophy\"],tags:[\"insight\"],authors:[\"rufuspollock\"],image:\"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-27.jpg\"};function d(t){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",em:\"em\",a:\"a\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",strong:\"strong\",img:\"img\",ol:\"ol\",li:\"li\",ul:\"ul\"},t.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"By Tomas Bj\\xF6rkman and Rufus Pollock.

Tomas Björkman is a social entrepreneur, philosopher and co-initiator of Emerge. Rufus Pollock is co-founder of Life Itself._ _This piece was cross-posted in Emerge, 27.1.2022_.\n\n_This piece is a result of a collaborative dialogue between Tomas Björkman (Ekskäret Foundation) and Rufus Pollock (Life Itself). We’d like to thank Theo Cox of Life Itself for his support in editing it._\n\n\nThrough our discussions, we noticed our thinking and work has a very similar perspective on the approach to social transformation – one linking the inner and the outer, the personal and the collective. We drafted this mini-essay initially simply to set out concretely our shared views, approach and strategy.  \n\nWe have chosen to share it more widely for a few reasons. First, we think that others may find the overall summary resonates with them and connects with their thinking and approach – especially the more general context and challenge sections. Second,  we would like to gather feedback and generate discussion around its content and thesis. Third, it could be an illustration for how other people and organizations create deeper alignment – this material was worked out over several sessions spanning several months.  \n\nFinally, we emphasize that this is but one of many ways to understand our current context and how to respond to it. We would very much like to hear from others who feel alignment or tension with what we have written. You can reach us via various channels, the best being https://lifeitself.org/contact/.\n\n\nOur key theses are:\n\n1\\. Transition is Needed: there is an urgent need for a transition from where things stand today.\n\n2\\. Transition is Paradigmatic: The transition involves a paradigmatic shift that includes a profound shift in worldview (views and values).\n\n3\\. Transition is Inner \u0026 Outer:  the transition involves the integration of the inner and the outer – personal/collective growth as well as systemic transformation.\n\n4\\. Transition prioritizes Being: whilst inner and outer are both needed, inner development has primacy, that is it should be prioritized and takes ultimate priority (also known as the “primacy of being” thesis).\n\n5\\. Transition requires Engagement (of the right kind): transition can be cultivated but not engineered. There is a middle way between passive disengagement (just letting it unfold) and arrogant engineering. The challenge is therefore to facilitate transition and cultivate emergence, rather than seeking to engineer it. \n\n\nHumanity and the planet are at a critical point in history similar to major breakdown/breakthrough points of the past, most recently the transition to modernity in the Enlightenment. We risk civilizational collapse and we also have the possibility of a breakthrough.\n\nThis transition cannot be “managed” or “engineered” but it can be facilitated and supported. In this vein, we have a sense of what the upwards transition would look and feel like:\n\nA.  Involve a focus on inner development i.e. the left quadrants in Ken Wilber’s quadrant model. Quadrants are a reference to Ken Wilber’s quadrant model matrixing inner and outer, singular and plural. We prioritize the \"inner\" left quadrants for two reasons. First, because they have been relatively neglected compared to the right quadrants in recent periods such as modernity (\"our technological powers have outstripped our wisdom to use them\"). This is not because the left quadrants are more important per se. Second, intellectual knowledge is easier to transmit than implicit knowledge - i.e. more mimetically fit. Thus, the inner may require more conscious effort and attention -- if not an imbalance between our inner and outer development will simply reflect the ease of transmission rather than any intentional neglect. For more on this latter point see  https://lifeitself.org/2017/09/10/four-types-of-problem/  e.g. \"And \\progress on being\\] requires conscious skilful effort and is not easily replicable – just because I get enlightened does not mean you do. But if I invent a better way to grow corn you can easily copy it.\" This is a thesis we term the “[primacy of being.”\n\nB.  An increasing capacity to relate to oneself, to others, to society, and to the planet in deeper and richer ways from a space of greater awareness and (inner) freedom.\n\nIn terms of where we are in the trajectory of breakthrough - or collapse - we have the following, very crude, guesstimates:\n\nFirst, there is a rapidly growing set of people who sense that things are wrong. That something is not working with the current paradigm – even if they might not frame it that way. We conjecture ~20%+ in places like Europe and North America. \n\nSecond, there is a much smaller subset of those who are not cynical or depressed and therefore potentially active. We hypothesize this group to be around ~2% of the population in a leading edge location e.g. Stockholm. \n\nThird, and finally, within that there is a subset who appreciate the above and are potential pioneers/facilitators of the next stage. This group is currently very small. Our wild speculation is that this is less than one in a thousand (0.1%) in leading edge locations.\n\nWe consider these groups roughly to map onto Fisher’s Personal Transition Curve, shown below.\n\n!\n\n\nFirst, without an upward transition, there is a high probability of a downward one, i.e. civilizational collapse. This would be a bad outcome in a great many waysFor those who are sanguine about humanity’s disappearance or view an over-concern as anthropocentric (e.g. “we are a cancer and the ecosystem would be better without us … etc”) it is worth noting that our downfall will hurt all living beings. We will fall because the ecosystem collapses, which will obviously be bad for the ecosystem. Plus the risk of extinction of humanity is not “good” because this represents (at least to our knowledge) a pinnacle of complexity so far – e.g. first example of self-awareness etc. Thus, we want an upwards transition.\n\nSecond, incremental patching of the old system is insufficient. these issues are foundational and go to the root of the existing paradigm at both a socio-economic and, more importantly, at a cultural and ontological level – the level of worldview and being.\n\nThird, simply “stepping back” and disengaging from our current situation is insufficient too. It is essential to have active engagement and support for a transition.\n\nThis must not be approached as “fixing” the problem, or come from the same arrogant engineering mindset which has led us to crisis in the first place – but it is also insufficient just to “step back and let the evolutionary process unfold”.\n\nInstead, we can focus on creating and shaping the conditions for emergence, through a combination of sense-making faculties that allow us both to attune and relate in a new way as well as to be in service to that which is unfolding.\n\nMetaphorically, we are gardeners, facilitators and improvisers rather than engineers or scientists. Moreover, it is an unavoidable reality that we are a key part of the evolutionary process and not apart from. Our choice is not to play a role or not but whether to be _conscious_ or _unconscious_ participants in the process. Being conscious seems not only wiser but also a responsibility. \n\nFourth, and finally, these views have not spread much, especially to the mainstream – that is, the views of the need for transition, its paradigmatic nature, and the need for engagement. Whilst there are “pioneers” (early adopters) they are still a tiny minority, un-networked; and lacking a common language.\n\nIn short, there is as yet no self-conscious “movement”. So much so, we don’t even know how many there are, and what terminology to use. Moreover, many who are, or could be part of this, don’t yet recognize each other. At a practical level, there is much that is needed, including:\n\n\nWe emphasize that there are, of course, existing initiatives that, for example, seek to map the ecosystem and connect actors and activities or seek to create frameworks for a meta-network. However, most are very early stage and we need to find ways to do so at scale.\n\n\nThis brings us to the key questions we seek to answer which are the following:\n\n\nBelow we have included the issue tree generated from the above question. The diagram breaks down the sub-questions we have to answer in order to generate an adequate response to the main question.\n\n!\n\n\nWe are at a very early stage in the Berkanatwo loop model with a few scattered people who really feel the necessary direction of change, within a larger set who are starting to sense something. \n\n!\n\nOne can set out in detail the plausible steps in a transition and the emergence of a new paradigm and where we are within it. Here is sufficient to say that we think pioneer groups are starting to connect and define key terms and framework for a global movement made of small localized communities, globally connected.\n\nGiven where we are in this process right now, we think in the nearer term (3-5-10 years) we should focus on connecting these pioneer groups, while starting to cocreate key terms and a framework for a global movement made of these small localized communities which are globally connected.\n\nRight now, a key priority is identifying other parties and aligning core initial activities, e.g. developing a shared language, research agenda, experiments in community building and so on. A start has been made in this ecosystem mapping project.\n\nOver the next 5 years we are going to start discovery and alignment workshops via snowball referrals in the field. Through these and related efforts we hope to identify key stakeholders and potential strategic partners, and map and connect the ecosystem in a way that supports its evolution and impact on wider society\n\nAs inner development is so crucial to this transition, a major focus will be on practices and spaces to cultivate and nurture sustained evolution.

We can also leverage consulting communities and other professional contacts for connections into the business world.\n\nFinally, it will be important to keep our eyes on the horizon and to imagine various longer-term scenarios (e.g. 30y and beyond) and how they would start to show up.
