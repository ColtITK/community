Most importantly we encourage openness for a diversity of perspectives and connecting with people who think and do differently and yet aspire to the same need for change.Â \n    \n2.  ðŸ’¯ Collaboration - Within connection, opens a creative space for collaboration between community members. This could be in the form of participating in an event, joining an organization, or simply creating ideas together.Â \n    \n3.  ðŸ“šEducation - This is a space for information sharing, skill sharing and knowledge development. We will carry out group discussions led by researchers, academicians, and industry experts. These discussions can be led by the community members as well; reach out to the admins to suggest your topic and schedule your group discussion.\n    \n4.  ðŸ’« Support - To foster mutual support between community members, whatever that might be. This is a space of encouragement, hope, and possibility.\n    \n## Ground Rules\n\nThe following invitations are shared to make this space a collaborative and accessible place for all. For the most part, these are simple common sense. If you show up with the purpose of collaboration, connection, education, and contribution the rest will simply occur organically.Â \n\n1.  Respect each other: Treat other members of the group with respect and kindness. Avoid using abusive or derogatory language towards anyone.\n    \n2.  Keep it clean: Refrain from sharing any inappropriate content like sexually explicit messages or images, vulgar jokes, hate speech, etc.\n    \n3.  Respect others boundaries: Communicating your boundaries and being aware of others boundaries will help maintain a good nature within the group, while making everyone feel safe. For example, if you want to reach out privately to someone in the group, ask for their permission publicly first.\n    \n4.  Self-promotion, but not too much: Weâ€™re excited to hear what you are up to if it makes sense to share it in the group. However, remember this is a space for everyone, so keep self-promotion to a reasonable frequency.Â \n    \n5.  Confidentiality: Do not share any personal or sensitive information about other members of the group without their consent.\n    \n6.  Be responsible: Take responsibility for your actions and the messages you share in the group. If you notice any violation of the guidelines, report it to the group admin immediately.\n    \n7.  Listen to others and respect each other's opinions: Pay attention to what others are saying and show interest in their opinions. Do not interrupt or talk over others, and be open to hearing different points of view even if you disagree.\n    \n8.  Be courteous: Say \"please\" and \"thank you\" when appropriate, and be polite in your interactions with others.\n    \n9.  Avoid personal attacks: Do not attack or insult other group members based on their race, gender, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Disagreements should be handled respectfully and without attacking the person.\n    \n10.  Â Stay on topic: Keep the conversations on-topic and relevant to the purpose of the group. Avoid sharing unrelated messages or spamming the group with unnecessary messages.\n    \n11.  Â Be concise: Keep the conversation focused on the topic at hand and avoid going off on tangents. This helps to keep the discussion productive and respectful.\n    \n12.  Â Share helpful content: Share content that is helpful or interesting to the group members. This could be news articles, memes, jokes, or anything else that adds value to the group.\n    \n13.  Â Be active: Participate in the group regularly by sharing your thoughts and ideas. This helps to keep the conversation lively and engaging.\n\nBy following these ground rules, we can create a safe and respectful community where everyone can freely express their opinions and ideas without any fear of judgment or harassment.\n\n## Community Calls\n\nCommunity calls are bi-monthly (usually on a Thursday evening GMT) for the community to connect in real time over a particular topic or discuss.Â \n\nThe exact time for calls may vary depending on availability of the organizers, however calls will usually be around 2 hours long.\n\nThe calls vary in format but may include:Â \n\n1.  Virtual Q\u0026A: Members of the community can ask questions and receive advice from a guest expert or panel of experts in a particular field.\n    \n2.  Networking event: Members can pitch their services and get feedback on their pitch. Other members can then support them in finding people to connect with their services.\n    \n3.  Book/article discussion: Discuss a book or article that members of the community have read prior to the call.\n    \n4.  Skill-building workshop: Members of the community can learn a new skill or technique related to their hobby or interest. This could include a mindfulness class, a coding class, or community living class\n    \n5.  Social event: Purely for socializing and getting to know other members of the community. This could include games, trivia, or other fun activities in small groups or pairs.\n    \n6.  Guest speaker or interview: A guest speaker or interviewee who is an expert in a particular field or has a unique perspective related to the community's interests, will share and create discussion.\n    \n7.  Community update or feedback session: Calls to share updates about the community's progress, goals, or initiatives, and gather feedback and suggestions from members.\n\n\u003e Have some feedback or ideas for improvement?
