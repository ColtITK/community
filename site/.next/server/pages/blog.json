It seems as if we are not equipped to talk collectively about something that might be the first consequence of climate change.\n\n## Yet the food crisis is no longer a threat but a reality\n\nThe globalization of our food production system no longer allows territories to ensure food sovereignty. The war in Ukraine has made its fragility visible.\n\nMono-cropping generates the risk of crop-destroying diseases in an almost constant way, and its adoption has contributed to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, soil health, and water tables.\n\nWe are in a continuous state of crisis management between war, disease and water shortages, and this is only accelerating. According to David Bailey, Director of the World Food Programme: \"After Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and southern Sudan, it is Somalia's turn to join the list of countries facing famine in 2023\". Food insecurity also appears to be on the rise within Europe. Today in France, for example, 30% of the population now have difficulty in obtaining healthy food with three meals a day. \n\nWe know the answer to this crisis. It is mainly structural: regain our food sovereignty by producing a locally autonomous agriculture mainly focused on plant production for humans (today ⅔ of agricultural land in France is dedicated to industrial animal feed). This general movement is underway, helped by public authorities and the PAT (territorial management plan  in France) among other initiatives. \n\nBut given the time needed to transform a globalized agricultural system, the time we have left may not be enough.   \n\nFurthermore, our relationship with food must evolve if we aim to be realistic, along with the time we dedicate to this activity – a duration that has decreased from 4 hours to 1 hour over the past 80 years in France.\n\nOn the other hand, if the change in agriculture will take several decades, the way in which we can change our relationship with food at home, in our communities and start to build an emotional resilience to the possible reduction in food shortage , can happen on time.\n\n## It is in this window that cooks have a crucial role to play. \n\nThey still have the time to develop culinary practices and connections that allow them to satisfy bodies and hearts in a deeper way that could bring peace to people and reduce anxiety. \n\nWe have enough time to develop a social technology that can withstand the panic of food insecurity and create a space of emotional security in the face of food anxiety and thus prototype a new food culture based on \"just enough\".\n\nIt is therefore urgent to ask the question of what are the strategies that will allow us not only to regulate ourselves emotionally in order to overcome the fear of the coming shortage, but also to rediscover the joy of living and creativity through the management of food as a collective.\n  \nThese models will not be able to emanate from a single axis such as anti-waste,fermentation, or solar cooking, but from a food ecosystem that allows us to respond to the fear of lack through the life force generated by community embodiment.  \n\nI see this evolution as a multi-pointed star: \n\n-    Good practice as humanity did before the Second World War: \n    \n-   support the farmers who feed us healthily \n    \n-   return to a way of cooking using few animal products and based mainly on cereals, vegetables and beans \n    \n-   relearn how to transform the abundance of summer into winter stock (fermentations, jars, sauces, dehydration). \n    \n-   no longer throwing away but systematically recycling \n    \n-   consider a way of cooking that respects the natural taste of the ingredients to achieve satiety that generates less appetite. \n    \n-   think of cooking in terms of balanced menus that generate satiety through variety (flavors, textures) rather than quantity \n    \n-   invent or adapting rituals to calm the fear of missing out \n    \n-   integrate contemplative silence into meals \n    \n-   generate the desire to increase the time devoted to our food (in the 1950 we spent 4 hours per day per household on food activities compared to 1 hour since 1990). \n    \n-   Deconstructing the notion of a fixed personal need: Developing facilities to realize the direct link between our relationship with food and the way it is produced. And if there is suffering, recognise the cultural responsibility of a system based on the fear of lack. \n\n### A Change of Posture \n\nEngage in revolution not because of the crisis but because of the joy and sense of belonging others that it brings. By the creative possibilities it can generate when we allow ourselves to be in-formed by its nourishment, developing our natural capacity to hear deeply what needs to be done and how.\n\nA dynamic posture that as Matt (current Life itself Praxis Hub resident) expressed it touches on rhythm in community. How to invite ourselves collectively to reappropriate food activities to be placed at the heart of the collective, and how to rethink food in movements integrated into a geography, a territory: the vegetable garden even if small, a lacto-fermentation lab, an oyster mushroom or shiitake culture, a dehydration space, a solar or terrestrial kitchen or any other idea that can both generate joy in a group and food resilience.  \n\n### The invisible power of collective activity \n\nTaking an interest in food collectively is, first and foremost, about organizing together, co-creating and sharing. It is the way to regain that sense of belonging that is essential to our emotional and mental equilibrium. In the context of mental health that is deteriorating exponentially and particularly among young people, proposing simple practices that make sense to live with others can transform the fear of the future into something more joyful. \n\nIt is therefore time for cooks to come together, to think together, to share their knowledge, to give themselves credibility and to mobilize as a living force of the transition in order to use their immense creativity and passion for the world in the development of processes that allow for a resilient food system in communities.\n\nTo Build together a different food narrative that empowers people, even in the midst of collapse. \n\nMy practice as a cook is directly inspired by the Tenzo practice of the Zen temples which, over the course of 800 years, have adressed the issue in such a way that it can serve as an inspiring framework. \n\nThe rest is up to the cooks, how to let yourself be inspired by collective creativity and let the solutions emerge in a relaxed and confident way? \n\nIn any case, this is my commitment and my passion at the Praxis Hub in Bergerac.\n\nIf these resonate in you like a call, then don't hesitate and come and join me in helping to pioneer the next food culture. \n\n>[[../../../../sympoiesis/conscious-food-workshop-june-2023|Join the upcoming conscious food residency]]\n\n\n\n---\n#### Sources\n\n 1.

It seems as if we are not equipped to talk collectively about something that might be the first consequence of climate change.\n\n\nThe globalization of our food production system no longer allows territories to ensure food sovereignty. The war in Ukraine has made its fragility visible.\n\nMono-cropping generates the risk of crop-destroying diseases in an almost constant way, and its adoption has contributed to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, soil health, and water tables.\n\nWe are in a continuous state of crisis management between war, disease and water shortages, and this is only accelerating. According to David Bailey, Director of the World Food Programme: \"After Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and southern Sudan, it is Somalia's turn to join the list of countries facing famine in 2023\". Food insecurity also appears to be on the rise within Europe. Today in France, for example, 30% of the population now have difficulty in obtaining healthy food with three meals a day. \n\nWe know the answer to this crisis. It is mainly structural: regain our food sovereignty by producing a locally autonomous agriculture mainly focused on plant production for humans (today ⅔ of agricultural land in France is dedicated to industrial animal feed). This general movement is underway, helped by public authorities and the PAT (territorial management plan  in France) among other initiatives. \n\nBut given the time needed to transform a globalized agricultural system, the time we have left may not be enough.   \n\nFurthermore, our relationship with food must evolve if we aim to be realistic, along with the time we dedicate to this activity – a duration that has decreased from 4 hours to 1 hour over the past 80 years in France.\n\nOn the other hand, if the change in agriculture will take several decades, the way in which we can change our relationship with food at home, in our communities and start to build an emotional resilience to the possible reduction in food shortage , can happen on time.\n\n\nThey still have the time to develop culinary practices and connections that allow them to satisfy bodies and hearts in a deeper way that could bring peace to people and reduce anxiety. \n\nWe have enough time to develop a social technology that can withstand the panic of food insecurity and create a space of emotional security in the face of food anxiety and thus prototype a new food culture based on \"just enough\".\n\nIt is therefore urgent to ask the question of what are the strategies that will allow us not only to regulate ourselves emotionally in order to overcome the fear of the coming shortage, but also to rediscover the joy of living and creativity through the management of food as a collective.\n  \nThese models will not be able to emanate from a single axis such as anti-waste,fermentation, or solar cooking, but from a food ecosystem that allows us to respond to the fear of lack through the life force generated by community embodiment.  \n\nI see this evolution as a multi-pointed star: \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nEngage in revolution not because of the crisis but because of the joy and sense of belonging others that it brings. By the creative possibilities it can generate when we allow ourselves to be in-formed by its nourishment, developing our natural capacity to hear deeply what needs to be done and how.\n\nA dynamic posture that as Matt (current Life itself Praxis Hub resident) expressed it touches on rhythm in community. How to invite ourselves collectively to reappropriate food activities to be placed at the heart of the collective, and how to rethink food in movements integrated into a geography, a territory: the vegetable garden even if small, a lacto-fermentation lab, an oyster mushroom or shiitake culture, a dehydration space, a solar or terrestrial kitchen or any other idea that can both generate joy in a group and food resilience.  \n\n\nTaking an interest in food collectively is, first and foremost, about organizing together, co-creating and sharing. It is the way to regain that sense of belonging that is essential to our emotional and mental equilibrium. In the context of mental health that is deteriorating exponentially and particularly among young people, proposing simple practices that make sense to live with others can transform the fear of the future into something more joyful. \n\nIt is therefore time for cooks to come together, to think together, to share their knowledge, to give themselves credibility and to mobilize as a living force of the transition in order to use their immense creativity and passion for the world in the development of processes that allow for a resilient food system in communities.\n\nTo Build together a different food narrative that empowers people, even in the midst of collapse. \n\nMy practice as a cook is directly inspired by the Tenzo practice of the Zen temples which, over the course of 800 years, have adressed the issue in such a way that it can serve as an inspiring framework. \n\nThe rest is up to the cooks, how to let yourself be inspired by collective creativity and let the solutions emerge in a relaxed and confident way? \n\nIn any case, this is my commitment and my passion at the Praxis Hub in Bergerac.\n\nIf these resonate in you like a call, then don't hesitate and come and join me in helping to pioneer the next food culture. \n\n>[[../../../../sympoiesis/conscious-food-workshop-june-2023|Join the upcoming conscious food residency]]\n\n\n\n---\n\n 1.

My job was simply to write it down and share it. Below you’ll find what came to me, which you can also watch in the video. \n\nI might just add an invitation to reflect on how you’re in touch with the world. Humans use touch to communicate non-verbally, often unconsciously, and I wonder what you say to others, to the more-than-human, and to yourself. \n\nI have spent years picking and prodding at my own body, saying “be small and smooth” instead of “thank you for holding me on this beautiful planet”. \n\nThe messages I give to my own body are the same ones I communicate to the life around me. I admit that my hands have often tried to fix and change rather than meet others with curiosity and thanks.  \n\nSo, for myself and for you, I pose two additional questions to the ones in the video:\n\n1.  How might we touch with reverence for life itself, rather than life’s utility?\n    \n2.   How might we touch in a dynamic of gracious attunement, rather than transaction? \n\n\n> **Be sure to join our [online community chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JNJCTZugNQn1fq89xbHtfA)and join the next community call, with another exciting presentation!**\n\n\n## The Presentation\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6p0dKyFCmA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI’m surprised by the threads I’m weaving together— philosophy of touch, relational ontology, grocery technology, the attention economy, and tactile practices of gratitude. But I heard a clear voice in my head saying, “Trust the path I sent you on.” I am trusting. \n\nThe combination of the subjects is new to me, but the threads themselves are not. I’ve been long nourished by these ideas, starting at my parents’ dinner table. It was a place of rosemary and thyme, of perfect and irreplicable soups. A place of heated debate, where one side saw the “health food store” as a safe haven and the other side saw it as the headquarters for the local elite (this was not a good thing). \n\nAnd touch? This thread is as old as my time here. As the first sense to develop in the womb, I felt in my earliest days that I was held utterly and completely by the world. Now on the outside, I’m still held utterly and completely though it feels different. \n\nTouch, surprisingly sitting in the middle on my list of love languages, is what I’ve studied for years. I learned that my culture ranks the senses in a hierarchy. Seeing and hearing sit at the top and are associated with the intellect, the mind, and men. Taste, smell, and touch are base, and of the body, associated with emotion and women. They are to be avoided in serious circles. \n\nBut touch, as I’m sure is the same with smell and taste, is so beautiful in its base fleshiness, emotion, and possibly its femininity. Our very embodiment means that we’re connected with the world, a truth we cannot shirk though some might try with dreams of a “disembodied” metaverse. Touch—the thing we cannot not do—is both an example and metaphor of our primordial interconnectedness. \n\nBut let’s get real. Hold your own hand. Try to find the precise boundary between one and the other. Try to discern which hand is touching and which hand is touched. \n\nYou’ll find that the sense eludes the binaries clever minds try to uphold. Our skin, just like our place in the world, is porous. Touching is never a mere connection between two things, one and two, but always is an infusion that darts a sly smile at individualism. \n\nResearch shows that humans are remarkably good at communicating nonverbally through touch. Nurses, for example, explained that prejudices and biases that don’t make it out of the mouth will find their way out in the hands. Some people are told, without words, that they deserve to be handled with kindness and others are told they are worthy of neglect and harshness. \n\nThis goes beyond the hospital walls. Some are led carefully and some are choked. Some boundaries are respected and some are transgressed. And as I wait for my son to be born, I wonder if I will handle him differently than I did my daughter.\n\nWhat, I wonder, do you and I say to the more-than-human world with our feet, hands and flesh of our cheeks? Years ago I wandered a meadow and felt paralyzed by my inability not to destroy the plants. Wherever I stood, however I sat, I squashed. I was horrified. Perhaps, then, touch has something to teach me about how my culture separates life and death. \n\nWe may turn to the more-than-human world we each touch in varying degrees each day. Food. That which nourishes us. We pick and squeeze, peel and chop, lift to our noses and place on our tongues. How often are these moments ones where thanks is communicated? How often is it that food is tossed, shoved, and treated without care?   \n\nIn the last years so much of this initial relationship building with food has been traded for scrolling and clicking on a smooth screen. Online grocery shopping was sometimes necessary under pandemic restrictions and has become ingrained in many of our weekly habits. Though we have personal relationships with our screens, it’s a surface without the particularity of a lemon rind or the skin of a unique tomato. Under the insidious guise of efficiency and the cultural obsession with optimizing every minute of daily life, we have lost so many opportunities to connect with our food.  \n\nI’m experimenting with reconnecting. My weekly shopping is now spread over several small shops and I feel what comes home with me. With my hands, I ask the lemons who would like to join the basket. This attentive and caring kind of touch magically transforms the very metaphysics of my kitchen. With a toddler the hours between 5-7pm require dinner, bath and bedtime. Until recently these two hours were fraught with urgency and felt constricting. Every time I turned around I would bump into something. \n\nThen I started touching with intention, sweetly saying with my hands, “thank you cauliflower” and “much gratitude onion!”. Suddenly the hours between 5-7pm became infused with spaciousness. Now there’s enough time and more than enough space—even with a little girl at my feet playing with pots. My shoulders unclench and there’s more ease.   \n\nI’m always already in touch with the world. But by adding some attention, I’m able to connect with more care. \n\nAnd so, I ask: If touch is such a powerful communicator, what do you say to your food? Do you speak words of domination and extraction? Or ones of thanks? Might you try out the latter a little more?\n\n> Madelaine is a philosopher and explorer of care, politics, feminism, ecology and our relationship with technology.

My job was simply to write it down and share it. Below you’ll find what came to me, which you can also watch in the video. \n\nI might just add an invitation to reflect on how you’re in touch with the world. Humans use touch to communicate non-verbally, often unconsciously, and I wonder what you say to others, to the more-than-human, and to yourself. \n\nI have spent years picking and prodding at my own body, saying “be small and smooth” instead of “thank you for holding me on this beautiful planet”. \n\nThe messages I give to my own body are the same ones I communicate to the life around me. I admit that my hands have often tried to fix and change rather than meet others with curiosity and thanks.  \n\nSo, for myself and for you, I pose two additional questions to the ones in the video:\n\n    \n\n\n> Be sure to join our online community chatand join the next community call, with another exciting presentation!\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m surprised by the threads I’m weaving together— philosophy of touch, relational ontology, grocery technology, the attention economy, and tactile practices of gratitude.

That said, if you are in any way interested in Web3, the guide provides a useful perspective which is often missing from the mainstream crypto narrative. \n\nWeb3 & crypto has become a massive phenomenon with bold claims made about its actual and potential impact. These claims go far beyond traditional technology boosterism (better, faster) to claims for radical transformation (and improvement) of our economic and social systems – for example, Web3 is revolutionary for X where X is everything from [money](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/money) and the economy to governance to funding [public goods](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/public-goods-problem) like (open) software, carbon removal etc.\n\nAs you may know, Life Itself is all about creating a wiser, weller world and you might assume that crypto and Web3 would fit into our repertoire of tools like fingers in a glove. Yet, during our initial exploration we felt that the Web3 space lacked the rigorous sensemaking necessary to make an informed decision about whether the claims were legitimate.  \n\n“As someone who aligns closely with many of the more progressive aspirations of the Web3 space, I think it’s really important we have an honest, good faith conversation about whether these technologies are the best way of fulfilling them,” says Theo Cox, Head of Life Itself Labs. \n\n“Too often discussions fracture into tribalism, with mud slinging from both sides on the basis of affiliations and vested interests. I wanted to move past that, into a space of “hey, we all want the same thing here. I may be more skeptical around Web3 as a way to achieve that, but here’s a detailed breakdown of the evidence and reasoning for my view so if you disagree, let’s talk”.\n\nThere was a gap in the collective knowledge surrounding Web3 and while there were many people critiquing its claims, no rigorous analysis had been made. So we did it! \n\n“To my knowledge this is the most detailed and evidence-based breakdown of the key claims made about Web3 technology. I hope it can not only help people make sense of the underlying mechanics of what’s going on, but also spark a more productive conversation. I’d love nothing more than for this to lead to discussions with people who disagree which move us all closer to our shared aspirations,” says Theo.\n  \n## What does the guide contain?\n\nThe guide explores the social, economical and political aspects of Web3 and Crypto with a particular focus on making sense of key claims often touted by proponents of Web3.  \n\nBy steel-manning these key claims through conscious, critical and open-minded dialog with a diverse set of experts, the guide teases out the underlying hypotheses and assumptions and then engages in rigorous and constructive critique. \n\nThe guide also explores the overall aspirations of the Web3 movement and examines how these might be achieved, whether through improvements to [blockchain](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/blockchain) based approaches or by other means.\n\nAll of this is neatly packaged into a stand-alone website from which the entire guide can be explored. It is split into three main sections: \n\n1.  Full analyses providing comprehensive and authoritative analyses of the biggest claims being made in the space. The following claims are analyzed:\n    \n\n-   [Bitcoin will (and should) become the new gold standard](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-bitcoin-will-and-should-become-the-new-gold-standard)\n    \n-   [Crypto will provide better payment and remittance services](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-will-provide-better-payment-and-remittance-services)\n    \n-   [Crypto can help solve the public goods problem](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-help-solve-the-public-goods-problem)\n    \n-   [Web3 can help revolutionize cooperation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-web3-can-help-revolutionize-cooperation)\n    \n-   [Crypto can provide better means of financializing non-financial value](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-provide-better-means-of-financializing-non-financial-value)\n    \n\n2.  Deep dive notes, which are detailed analysis notes from our deep dive conversations. These have not yet been formatted and expanded into full analyses ([You can help](https://web3.lifeitself.org/meta/editing)). We've undertaken deep dives on the following claims:\n    \n\n-   [Blockchain can (and should) be used to create “networked states” to replace existing nation states](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-blockchain-can-and-should-be-used-to-create-networked-states-to-replace-existing-nation-states)\n    \n-   [Crypto can act as an anti-authoritarian force](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-can-act-as-an-anti-authoritarian-force)\n    \n-   [The crypto space is just an unfettered market, and there’s nothing wrong with that](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-the-crypto-space-is-just-an-unfettered-market-and-theres-nothing-wrong-with-that)\n    \n-   [Crypto is just the latest evolution of fintech, and is leading us towards a better financial system](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-is-just-the-latest-evolution-of-fintech-and-is-leading-us-towards-a-better-financial-system)\n    \n-   [Crypto should remain outside of securities regulation](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide#claim-crypto-should-remain-outside-of-securities-regulation)\n    \n\n3.

How indeed can I remain idle in front of the homeless, the slaughtered animals, the beaten women and children, how can I not act to help people who are victims of social injustice, of racism, how can I not rush to the people who are stranded on our coasts etc.?\n\nHowever, in my experience, when I adopt a posture of circumspection, then the larger question appears of what builds this common sense, what is at the origin of our actions?\n\nIn my cultural context this common-sense-activist perspective of me sitting on the cushion seems to stem from: \n\n* The intention to do good \n- The deep conviction that we are fully capable of analyzing a problem and therefore of solving it. \n- The certainty that once the problem is analyzed, it is enough to act on it. \n\nBut this ordinary functioning of reactivity to the world, is for me informed by the special human ability to forget to question the way in which our personal ethics or our capacity to perceive reality is constructed.\n \nAnd it is realistic to conceive that what we perceive as \"reality\" most often concerns our projections resulting in a phenomenal co-production of all the experiences we have lived since our childhood and even earlier. \n\nWe also forget to question the intention with which we carry out our actions and that an enthusiasm based solely on the morality of the good can also have the effect of feeding the tensions that we are trying to resolve. \n\nSo what does a cushion have to offer me? How can I have the nerve to say that it is by sitting down that I will find another answer to the infinite boomerang effect of my most beautiful impulses? And how can I benefit from this sitting when I walk the path of activism? How can I hear what sounds like an irreconcilable paradox: the activism of contemplation in the form of sitting, begging, deep listening circles, silent retreats of all that sits the body mind?   \n\n## Simply sitting \n\n\"When I eat I eat, when I sleep I sleep\" says the wise man.\n\nSitting down and then, in this state of non manufacturing of thoughts, getting up from the cushion to cook, eat and simply live is the deeply disturbing proposal of sitting without a goal in front of the complexity of the world. At first sight it seems insane, but it is just as relevant as the one that consists in following without stopping for a moment everything we think we should do in the name of a conditioned good. \n\nSitting with a relaxed back and a straight spine (on the floor or on a chair, it doesn't matter) is our natural posture, that of babies who without tension stand with their spine spread out on their sacrum, and at the same time something extremely complicated, so much so that in our lives we have lost the sense of balance, so much so that we struggle against the gravity of the earth.  \nCarried by our thoughts, it is often our head that drives our body, physically but also mentally because our being is body-mind, whether we like it or not. The one cannot be separated from the other except conceptually.\n\nTo observe ourselves walking is very interesting if we want to know our relationship to the world: do we put our head first or our steps? Can we bring our upper body backwards without feeling fear or, on the contrary, confidence? Do we allow ourselves to stop and let go of the weight along the spine, release tension and automatically feel the opening of another space for thought/action? \n\nThe Alexander Technique approach to body posture talks about direction and inhibition. The concept is disarmingly simple: since early childhood we have produced conditioned reflexes which are often useless and tiring as we strain against the various injunctions of our parents and then of society. Thus, even the way we get up from a chair calls upon most of the back muscles (the volitional muscles) when our body is made in such a way that it has the freedom, when given the possibility, to function without tensing up (thanks to the deep muscles).\n\nThe methodology of the Alexander technique is literally \"not doing\": we put the intention to stand up (set the direction) but we don't do it, and in this space freed from conditioned movement, we relax and allow the deep muscles to take over. When we start moving again, in our direction, it is done without any effort. This simple pause \"between intention and action\" will deconstruct the muscular-mental body habit and offer again the possibility to the body-mind to function more freely in the adjusted and not conditioned effort. \n\nThis approach to non-doing is similar to the 'sitting without purpose' meditation of zazen in Japanese. As Issho Fujita says in his footnotes on zazen, \n“When we are absorbed in our thoughts, thinking about this or that - as usual - it is a function of the 'muscular-outer mind'. In the common French expression, we say: \"use your head\". In contrast, the \"inner mind muscle\" has the function of supporting the appearance and disappearance of thoughts at the basic level. It allows intuition, awareness and full consciousness to appear. Here again, in zazen, we can say that we are calming down an excessive activity of outer mind muscle and activating and\nmanifesting the function of the inner mind muscle which has been suppressed.\n\nDeveloped by Master Dogen in the 12th century, the particularity of zazen is that the mind of \"not doing\" goes through the posture of the body. His vision is still to this day considered radical in Buddhism, as it affirms the possibility of freeing ourselves from our conditioned reflexes by simply sitting; he goes as far as to affirm that awakening is the posture. To understand a little better what Dogen means by posture but also in what brings us to consider this practice of uninhibited posture as activism (of contemplation), we have to go back to the school of philosophy of Yogacara founded by Vasubandhu around the 5th century. \n\nThis philosophy speaks to us (as does all of Buddhism) about the confusion between reality as it is and our perception of the world. It is radically based on the fact that nothing has its own substance. Matter is formed and deformed according to the perception of the observer who influences the reality of this matter. Nothing exists in itself but is a game of crossed perceptions conditioning the actions resulting from it, themselves products of our projections. Nihilism is not far away and Dogen’s philosophy has often been judged as such but this is to misunderstand its purpose; on the contrary, it is at the root of contemplative activism.\n\nIn Yogacara school, the notion of a \"memory chamber of our consciousness\" is proposed, where all our actions and the experience we have gained from them are stored: Alaya Vijnaya. The school also proposes the space of the ego (manas) which would draw from this \"memory chamber\" of how to make sense of its individuality by creating a history from this fabric of experiences. A very simple example is, if  a child is given sweets every time it works well, it will probably have the desire to celebrate successful work with sweets all their life. \n\nWe find these principles developed later by psychology. But when psychology will rather focus on understanding the constitutive effects of these experiences on our identity and, according to the therapies, influence our behaviors, another proposal will be born from this cartography of the mind: that of dynamic absorption, the simple sitting in the active porosity of life as it is; chan na, zazen in Japanese. \n\nTo take the direction of sitting upright, not doing and letting oneself be unformed by the innate capacity of the body-mind to form itself again in continuity, such is the non-methodology of this sitting.  \n\nThe meaning of this meditation (zazen) is based on the principle that if we cut the causal mechanics existing between the experiential memory (memory chambers) and the way we build ourselves (the ego), we will divert the \"ordinary\" effects of the way we perceive ourselves, the world and our actions. \n\nSo it is really the action that is at stake in this sitting.\n\nCompared to other meditations, the proposal of zazen has the particularity that it has no objective and even the intention of \"letting it happen\" of the posture must be abandoned here, if we want to really \"let it happen\". Here, all the thoughts constructed by Alaya and filtered by Manas are left to themselves and stop making the tensions of acting and doing, certainties and opinions. We stop the thread of the story that we tell ourselves simply by not participating in it anymore, by not grasping it. Comfortably installed in our conditioning, in full awareness of our illusions, we rest. When the mental productions appear, we say hello to them but without “inviting them to tea” as D.T. Suzuki used to say. \n\nAnd like a computer, the fact of no longer doing, of letting what comes as it comes emerge without keeping or rejecting, we operate, in all unconsciousness, a radical deconstruction of our way of being in the world; a hard disk reset. \n\nSimply by being in the receptive disposition of all that crosses us, we free ourselves from all our conditioning, instantly and without any possibility of seeing it. This is the notion of awakening according to Dogen, an expression of absolute reality that is perfectly elusive and completely outside of any personal desire.  \n\nThis dynamic of Self-realization is a profoundly revolutionary way of living because it no longer seeks to escape from causality but, by diving into it, creates other routes, other possibilities, and, thanks to the receptivity generated by the open posture, it will activate all of our creativity in order to be able to act rather than react. \n\nIt will also, of course, create new causalities, other projections, other illusions because it is our lot as humans to produce thought, first of all with the language that must define, delimit, but if we remain in this movement of never grasping anything, then this sitting promises us from moment to moment the dynamic resilience of an interphenomenal self that adjusts itself infinitely. \n\nIf there is no longer an objective, if there is nothing to reach, to solve, to find, if our transformation no longer depends on us but on our capacity to become receptive, to let ourselves be in-formed rather than always seeking to transform ourselves, then a great relaxation takes place. \n\nFrom this relaxation, a new form of action different from our ordinary way emerges and the true power of action is activated as a result of this continuous deconstruction of our conditioned self. \n\nIt is in this that the posture is activism; contemplative activism.\n\nThe posture of the tenzo (the cook in Zen) is the dynamic expression of this space of inhibition of action in the direction that unfolds in all activities of our life. Its invitation brings us back into the flow of our daily life, bridging the gap between the sitting posture and the deep spirit of the posture that reveals itself in each of our movements. \n\nThe practice of tenzo offers us to dive into all the activities of our life in the relativity of our singularity, in the obligation that we have to choose, to decide to take charge while acting from the same space freed as that of the sitting. \n\nThis is why, to the reaction \"but we can't just sit!\", the response is that we don't just sit, because sitting in this context is first and foremost a dynamic posture that unfolds throughout our lives, in meditation as well as in the kitchen, and everywhere else as long as we set a direction.  \n\nTo explore this topic further join us in the Bergerac Praxis Hub this May. The spirit of posture is something fundamental to the Praxis Hub and will be particularly explored in the next Ouroboros residency (May 2023) in the context of internalized patriarchy.

I'm really privileged today to be joined by Jeffery Martin. Jeffery is a founder of the transformative technology space. He's a serial entrepreneur and a social scientist who researches personal transformation and the state of the greatest human wellbeing. And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call. And I really just want to welcome you to the podcast, Jeffery. So thank you for joining us.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 01:26\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 01:28\n\nYeah, and I thought we could maybe start, if you would just tell us a little bit about these key terms in your work, which is Fundamental Wellbeing or Persistent, Non-Symbolic Experience, which is a bit of a mouthful. Can you say a bit about what those are?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 01:46\n\nRight? Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 06:43\n\nSo in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 07:46\n\nAbsolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 10:27\n\nSo, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often. And as it says, Fundamental Wellbeing doesn't have to have this spiritual aspect, but it encompasses all those experiences, or as you said, awakening might be now becoming a more common term and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is the other term. So how did you come to this area? You know, can you tell me a bit about your life story? Where did you start and what led you to get interested in this?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 11:01\n\nAbsolutely. So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me. Back then I was still a hyper aggressive, hyper competitive type A type of person. And so really, what I did at that point was just set out to become the happiest person ever, right? I never set out to like, write books about this or anything like that. It was sort of like, I'm gonna win the happiness game like I'm gonna win every other game.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:07\n\nWhat job were you in at that time? What had you been doing? Like, what sort of work?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 13:12\n\nAt that point I was running companies and teaching. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:18\n\nWhat I mean, is were you working in wellbeing already? No, no, no. The companies spanned real estate, technology, media, those sectors. Speficially infromation technology, IT.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 13:39\n\nAdvertising for media. In the media, I'd moved on from like, you know, running TV stations or station groups or something like that to focusing on marketing, advertising, you know, where the money was, right?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:51\n\nWhere the money was. And so then you're like, okay, I'm going to win the happiness contetst, I'm now going to bring that energy. So what did you do next? How did you begin?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 14:03\n\nYeah, so I had had enough interaction over the years with academics, especially having done a lot of teaching in different environments, to realise that they were not going to be able to produce the truth. I knew I needed a research project that could produce, really, the truth, but I realised, in the academic world, the name of the game is basically grant chasing, right? And so, you know, they're gonna just basically try to get little incremental gains and publish little papers and suck as much money out of you as they can for as long as they possibly can, you know, because you're a new source of revenue for them basically. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 14:41\n\nThat was if you went and did grants or like commissioned research?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 14:44\n\nYeah, because I could have, right? I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody. And so I don't even have to really change my life.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 18:01\n\nWhen was this?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 18:07\n\nI think it started in 2006. And I found out about it like two weeks before it started and basically begged my way into the programme at the last minute. So I'm in this programme on transdisciplinary scholarship, and it is fantastic and it has a lot of Europeans in it teaching remotely because they don't actually have to be in San Francisco and all of that. And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right? Obviously, it didn't turn out that way. 17 years or 18 years later and here we are now.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 19:40\n\nFast forward a little bit. So you're working with Allan Combs, you're working at the California Institute for Integral Studies, and where did your investigation start? What did you actually start doing in your investigation? Once you've got your tools, what were you starting to investigate?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 20:05\n\nI was really just trying to find the happiest people out there. And I had an inkling, the reason Allan was interesting to me was because I've done some research before this, now I wasn't a scholar before this, right, I had masters degrees in management and stuff like that and technology and things. So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end. And so yeah, so that was the story.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 21:59\n\nSo to recap that, you'd already had this inkling, and it is an intriguing fact, that obviously there's this huge self help movement. And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do? \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 22:50\n\nYeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 27:05\n\nHow did you find them that to start with? How did what how did you find very happy people?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 27:13\n\nThat cost a lot of money, initially. Originally, I thought the main barrier to this project is that the people who could do it, who have an interest in it and who might be willing to do it on nights and weekends, basically believe that there's like six of these people in the world, at any given time and their odds of actually getting to them and researching them are non existent. And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was. So an established system, with well defined criteria, that groups of people that are, you know, reasonably knowledgeable on those criteria, could look at someone and say, that person is there. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 28:40\n\nSo what you were looking for, just to play this back and you explain it for listeners, what you were saying is to do good empirical research, you need a couple of things. So one is you're goning to need a way to then assess people, like to find out what was different about them, but then the toughest problem was actually finding a research population, or at least rigorous research, which was also having criteria for identifying people in Fundamental Wellbeing, that was not like fully objective, but at least there was like criteria and there was a community of practice that would kind of validate those criteria. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 29:19\n\nThose individuals specifically, not just the criteria, but the individuals as having met the criteria.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 29:27\n\nRight. Okay. So, you know, they've experienced in oneness or other behaviours, okay. So that was one thing, so you'd find a community probably, maybe a traditional religious one that has that, what were the other two?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 29:38\n\nNo, that was really sort of the heart of it, right, is that they had to have those three components: so it's an established tradition with rules and then people agreeing that a person fits the rules that are within the tradition and that are a valid enough group that could judge that. And that is basically the idea.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 30:03\n\nAnd then you said it was pretty expensive to find them, you said that was the most costly part. Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 37:10\n\nEmotion, that kind of thing. Yeah.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 37:12\n\nYeah. So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 37:36\n\nWell, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day. And so there were things like that, examples like that.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 41:48\n\nWow. Okay. And I think just also I want to flag this for ourselves and for listeners, what's amazing in a way about this, and it's so obvious, is we've moved from what would otherwise be very incomparable experiences, to things that start to be very noticeable, like a reduction in thoughts. What I'm also hearing is that often there was a strong before and after, there was strong changes that were noticeable around their waking up experiences. So I think that's really amazing. And at this point, how many people had you talked to at the end of this first phase?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 42:42\n\nThe first phase lasted for a number of years. In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east. We wanted to sample as broad a range of this as we could, in those early days, especially. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 44:34\n\nAnd I want to ask one other question on that, the other thing that intrigued me in looking at your work previously was that also you started to come across people who were not in any system, people who'd somehow, as it were, transitioned into Fundamental Wellbeing, and who weren't Christian, Buddhist or anything. When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 45:07\n\nYou know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 48:17\n\nSo just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 49:49\n\nWe didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research. And so that really held true for a very long time.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 54:12\n\nOkay, so at this point, this is, what five years into your project or something? \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 54:22\n\nSix, seven, a few years.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 54:25\n\nYeah, yeah. Because at some point, you've got enough data, and then I think we're coming towards the first Finders programme, I'd like to talk about that. You said you're interested in, when you mentioned these six people, you had this moment, like, maybe we can build a protocol that can help people actually transition to Fundamental Wellbeing. Is that right? Is that what I'm understanding from what you were just alluding to when you said about the book list? Could you say a bit about that?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 54:54\n\nYeah, basically, you know, the first few years we're doing all this interview stuff. So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there? And frankly we didn't.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 56:53\n\nThere being Fundamental Wellbeing? One thing, just to make it obvious for people on this call, you know, it may be obvious to you but I just want to flag, I might have in my life have seen some people who are just born happy; some people are just born lucky. Something that I assume you haven't mentioned, but you would have learnt from your first set of subjects, or people you talk to, was that they hadn't always been like this, or some of them maybe had been, but can I take that as one thing that we've almost said unsaid, that there have been times?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 57:01\n\nYeah, Fundamental Wellbeing, exactly.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 57:05\n\nYeah, for sure. There are a very tiny number of people who always seem to be in this. Like the thing that happens to the rest of us around age two and a half to three and a half doesn't happen to them and they just have spent their whole life in Fundamental Wellbeing, but that's a vanishingly small number of people. Okay. But so many people in your early interviews had reported some kind of transition or whatever, it had taken several experiences, but they had a real before and after. And that's the thing, I think, also is a really big insight, I know it comes out of many traditions, but what you want to flag is that Fundamental Wellbeing is both something that can kind of be, I don't want to say secularised, but you can see these criteria and things that really affect the quality of your life. and it is kind of this transition and often it's not gradual, I get from many of your people, it had been quite rapid at some point.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 58:27\n\nIt was about 70%, instant, 30% gradual in that early population of 1200 people, during those early years.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 58:35\n\nAnd for them, also, what you're getting is, it's kind of noticeable if it happens to you. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 58:39\n\nEven if it's gradual, you still realise. Interestingly, you can not notice it initially, because you have such a drop off and self reflective block, right? And after the transition, you're not like constantly analysing what's going on with you, or whether you're happy or whether someone likes the blue jacket that I'm wearing, or, you know, all of that neuroticism just sort of goes away. So, you actually kind of miss that you've transitioned to this. And even like super famous people told us like, you know, they didn't notice it sometimes for weeks or months afterward, and then they'd be like, you know, pontificating on it in some, you know, religious environment where they were considered an expert on it, even though they hadn't gotten there yet, but they were like, some senior teacher or something, right. And they're like, checking off in their mind the boxes, and at some point, they're like, Oh, I wonder when that happened? So it's kind of a funny aside.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 59:34\n\nThat is very funny. So yeah, people could not notice. And to come back then, you were then starting to look, if we want to understand more about what's going on, we really would like to find situations where people actually transition. \n\n**Jeffery Martin** 59:51\n\nAnd measure them before and after. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 59:53\n\nAnd I'm almost hearing that you came up with the protocol or a way of trying to support people doing that, because otherwise, you'd have to like be with lots of people and like most of them wouldn't transition, and there's no kind of predictable way. And that's one of the things I want to ask about because you could be like, oh, wouldn't it be easy? Why wouldn't you just go to some of these gurus and say, like, just find me some of your students, surely some of them are going to wake up in the next few months. One of the things that you'd maybe been seeing was that that wasn't generally the case, that people reliably transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing, even in these spiritual traditions, it was a bit more random, even there, is that right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:00:32\n\nAlmost nobody transitioned, you know, and we had really well known spiritual teachers, when we would ask for a referral to some of their students to participate in the research, who would confide in us that they're not sure anybody ever woke up from, you know, their teachings, we learned that this was considered one of the most frustrating professions out there, if you weren't in Fundamental Wellbeing, it's hard to imagine that you could keep doing this day in and day out, because it was just, you know, having very little actual impact in terms of the transition to fundamental well being on people. And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number. And he's like, as far as I know, no one has ever transitioned that I've worked with, he's like, you know, what can you tell me about what I can do differently? And I'm like, well, I can tell you that's normal. You're in good company, you know, your competitors in the spiritual space aren't like, you know, really lapping you on this one, right. And we had a great conversation about it. I mean, these types of conversations were not uncommon, you know. And so the problem for us in that when wanting to measure people before and after was, despite our global reach at this point, there wasn't any place that we could think to go, where it had, you know, enough of a hit rate, to justify paying for them to be in a scanner beforehand and then, you know, just having thrown away that 700 bucks, or whatever it would have cost, you know, for the scanner time,\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:02:38\n\nI do just want to flag this Jeffery because I think also for listeners, for those interested, you know, obviously, you could pick up a book, I could pick an example, like Culadasa's book, which people might know, The Mind Illuminated, a classic guide to at least Buddhist meditation. And at the beginning it's kind of like, look, if you really do this, well, the Dalai Lama reckons you could do this in a year. There is this tendency to be like, just do the meditations right in this particular practice. So I just want to flag this point, which is that that insight is quite significant, I think, and I think this may have to run into a second interview, potentially, but even at this point, I want to come to it, that is a really significant point, because there is a tendency in a lot of the teaching of a tradition lik just do the meditation practices right and, you know, in like a year, you know, you should be able to get to level 10. There's an incredible frustration that you often don't, and maybe a surprise that also things aren't highly effective. And I think there's also the tendency that it is so amazing when it does occur for people, they're just like, well I was just doing that if you just do that particular mantra, or you do this particular thing, or just do this extreme sport, and, you know, whatever it is, there's a tendency to perhaps extrapolate, over extrapolate from one's own experience, particularly also once when in Fundamental Wellbeing I think there's a haziness about the prior period of the journey. You  came to this because you were looking to look at before and after.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:04:30\n\nThe thing to think about with this, right, is that in most Eastern traditions, that's okay. And in Western traditions, to some degree too, in Western traditions, you just sort of generally have to be right with God to get to the right heaven, right. And so if you don't actually have a mystical union experience with it, but you're, you know, you're pious and devout or whatever, that's an okay way to spend your life. On the eastern side, you've always got more lifetimes, right? And so there isn't really an expectation of a lot of success on the Eastern tradition side of thinks, right? So it's only in sort of like a new non dualish sort of guy like the one that I gave an example of that they're bothered by this, you know. If you're steeped in Hinduism or Buddhism, it's just sort of like, well, of course, nobody's making that much progress because you make progress over 1000s of lifetimes. So I think you do have to put that frame, it's not like there's some ethical problem for them, like, you know, they're out there saying this, and it's not producing the result, they're assuming it's going to produce results over many lifetimes. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:04:30\n\nYes, there's even a sense, I think, in many traditions, we have to be careful here, that it can be like kind of grasping after things, it can become like another thing on the list like, I think you jokingly referred to yourself at the beginning like, you know, I aced everything else now I'm going to ace well being. And obviously, there's this kind of subtilty, but to come to it then, you were coming to look at it before and after. The protocol, what brought you towards like looking at creating a structure to support people in transition?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:06:09\n\nWe just wanted to collect AB data, you know, we just wanted to collect before and after data, that was our only real impetus.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:06:16\n\nSo what happened? So tell me a bit, you found six people from your list? And what was it you created? Tell us a bit about this.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:06:23\n\nWe tried a whole bunch of stuff, you know, beforehand, before the six people, long before those six people, we tried all sorts of brain zapping methods, things like that. That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods. So let's say there's like half a dozen general categories of methods, we have since collapsed that down to five categories of methods, but at the time it was like half a dozen categories of methods.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:08:42\n\nFor listeners, just what do you mean by method?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:08:45\n\nSo, you know, for instance, it might be a meditation method, like a mantra-based method, right? We've learned that, you know, most mantra-based methods don't transition people, there's, you know, some subsets of some very specific types of mantra methods that do. And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:09:43\n\nSo just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods. And then the point, which you said, I think is also a really big insight for listeners, and anyone interested, and obviously you can find more in Jeffery's work and the course 45 days to awakening, which I highly recommend. But the basic point was that you have good methods, but any given method only works for certain people, that's what you mean by matching, is that right?\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:10:20\n\nExactly, exactly. And so, it's not enough to have a list, with instructions even from the best form of these gold standard type of methods that are most likely to work on a small percentage of people, let's say 3% of people, or 4% of people, I mean, if you've got a method that works on 3 or 4%, of people reliably, you've invented one of the best methods ever, you know, that is an enormously successful method and hit rate. Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:12:55\n\nJust for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:13:07\n\nA four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:13:10\n\nYeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before. And that's extraordinary, that is extraordinary results.\n\n**Jeffery Martin** 1:13:29\n\nYeah, it is. To us it's just so routine now that you know, at the time, it was like, this is incredible, you know, but now it's sort of like, it's normal.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:13:37\n\nI got that and there are many other things like how can more people do it, but what I just want to say on that point, and I think that's what we could delve into in a follow up, I hope, with this, Jeffrey, and I want to get a moment to thank you, but I want to leave you and listneners with the question, what's amazing for me is that we got to do this in this way, that this journey of empiricism can be useful, open minded empiricism can be really, really valuable. And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much.

He's a serial entrepreneur and a social scientist who researches personal transformation and the state of the greatest human wellbeing. And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call.

Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 06:43\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 07:46\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Absolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 10:27\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often.

So how did you come to this area? You know, can you tell me a bit about your life story? Where did you start and what led you to get interested in this?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 11:01\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Absolutely. So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me.

And so, you know, they're gonna just basically try to get little incremental gains and publish little papers and suck as much money out of you as they can for as long as they possibly can, you know, because you're a new source of revenue for them basically.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 14:41\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That was if you went and did grants or like commissioned research?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 14:44\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, because I could have, right? I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody.

And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right?

So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end.

And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 22:50\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 27:05\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"How did you find them that to start with?

And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was.

Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 37:10\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Emotion, that kind of thing.

So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 37:36\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`Well, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day.

In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east. We wanted to sample as broad a range of this as we could, in those early days, especially.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 44:34\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And I want to ask one other question on that, the other thing that intrigued me in looking at your work previously was that also you started to come across people who were not in any system, people who'd somehow, as it were, transitioned into Fundamental Wellbeing, and who weren't Christian, Buddhist or anything. When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 45:07\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`You know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 48:17\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 49:49\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research.

So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there?

Okay. But so many people in your early interviews had reported some kind of transition or whatever, it had taken several experiences, but they had a real before and after. And that's the thing, I think, also is a really big insight, I know it comes out of many traditions, but what you want to flag is that Fundamental Wellbeing is both something that can kind of be, I don't want to say secularised, but you can see these criteria and things that really affect the quality of your life. and it is kind of this transition and often it's not gradual, I get from many of your people, it had been quite rapid at some point.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 58:27\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"It was about 70%, instant, 30% gradual in that early population of 1200 people, during those early years.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 58:35\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And for them, also, what you're getting is, it's kind of noticeable if it happens to you.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 58:39\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Even if it's gradual, you still realise.

Why wouldn't you just go to some of these gurus and say, like, just find me some of your students, surely some of them are going to wake up in the next few months.

And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number. And he's like, as far as I know, no one has ever transitioned that I've worked with, he's like, you know, what can you tell me about what I can do differently? And I'm like, well, I can tell you that's normal. You're in good company, you know, your competitors in the spiritual space aren't like, you know, really lapping you on this one, right. And we had a great conversation about it. I mean, these types of conversations were not uncommon, you know. And so the problem for us in that when wanting to measure people before and after was, despite our global reach at this point, there wasn't any place that we could think to go, where it had, you know, enough of a hit rate, to justify paying for them to be in a scanner beforehand and then, you know, just having thrown away that 700 bucks, or whatever it would have cost, you know, for the scanner time,\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:02:38\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I do just want to flag this Jeffery because I think also for listeners, for those interested, you know, obviously, you could pick up a book, I could pick an example, like Culadasa's book, which people might know, The Mind Illuminated, a classic guide to at least Buddhist meditation. And at the beginning it's kind of like, look, if you really do this, well, the Dalai Lama reckons you could do this in a year. There is this tendency to be like, just do the meditations right in this particular practice. So I just want to flag this point, which is that that insight is quite significant, I think, and I think this may have to run into a second interview, potentially, but even at this point, I want to come to it, that is a really significant point, because there is a tendency in a lot of the teaching of a tradition lik just do the meditation practices right and, you know, in like a year, you know, you should be able to get to level 10. There's an incredible frustration that you often don't, and maybe a surprise that also things aren't highly effective. And I think there's also the tendency that it is so amazing when it does occur for people, they're just like, well I was just doing that if you just do that particular mantra, or you do this particular thing, or just do this extreme sport, and, you know, whatever it is, there's a tendency to perhaps extrapolate, over extrapolate from one's own experience, particularly also once when in Fundamental Wellbeing I think there's a haziness about the prior period of the journey.

That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods.

And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:09:43\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods.

Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:12:55\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Just for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Jeffery Martin\"}),\" 1:13:07\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"A four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:13:10\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before.

And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much.

I'm really privileged today to be joined by Jeffery Martin. Jeffery is a founder of the transformative technology space. He's a serial entrepreneur and a social scientist who researches personal transformation and the state of the greatest human wellbeing. And even that brief introduction doesn't really do justice to the breadth of Jeffery's work. He spent over 15 years conducting the largest international study on persistent non symbolic experience, or as its publicly known fundamental wellbeing, which includes the type of consciousness commonly known as persistent awakening or enlightenment, non duality, the peace that passeth understanding, unitive experience and so on. And most recently, I think, even more intriguingly, he's been using that research to make protocols, toolkit tools available to people to obtain these profound psychological benefits in a rapid, secular, reliable and safe way. And he's done extensive research, he's lectured at many events, he's been involved in transformative technology space, and he's going to share more about that on the call. And I really just want to welcome you to the podcast, Jeffery. So thank you for joining us.\n\nJeffery Martin 01:26\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nRufus Pollock 01:28\n\nYeah, and I thought we could maybe start, if you would just tell us a little bit about these key terms in your work, which is Fundamental Wellbeing or Persistent, Non-Symbolic Experience, which is a bit of a mouthful. Can you say a bit about what those are?\n\nJeffery Martin 01:46\n\nRight? Fundamental Wellbeing and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience, which one of those is the academic term, and which one of those is the public term, right? They basically are the same thing. Like you say, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is a mouthful for the public to try to get into. And so we thought, we need a better phrase for it. And we really wanted something that accurately described it. And so you know, the marketing side of the world was like, oh, you should call it Extraordinary Wellbeing or something like that. But it just didn't really fit the nature of the experience. And so we went with Fundamental Wellbeing. So they're basically the same thing. One is just the term that we use when we're writing papers, and talking in academic conferences, and the other one is when we're writing books, for the public. The gist of it is that it's a shift in the human nervous system, away from what we think of as old and outdated wiring. Right. So if you're sitting in a cafe, and you know, a bird lands near your table, and you toss it a crumb, what happens? Well, the bird generally looks around first, right? And it makes sure that it's not going to get killed, and then it pecks it the crumb. And then it looks around again, to make sure it's not going to get killed and takes another peck at the crumb. I think we as humans are like, oh, what primitive behaviour in the bird, look at how the bird is so jittery and all of that, right? What we don't realise is that we've got that same wiring inside of us, right? All animals have the same wiring, we've got the same cycle that's playing out in our nervous system that is, in every moment, in our case it's like at least every 90 seconds or so, basically checking in and making sure like, hey, is the ceiling I'm under right now, you know, raining plaster? Do I need to run for my life or whatever else? Right? And so there's this sense that something is just not quite right, in this moment, or potentially not quite right in this moment. And that's at a very foundational level of the nervous system. It's built up. I mean, it's in birds and everything else, right. So it's way way in those old parts of the nervous system. And it's been built on, you know, layer over layer over layer over layer as our nervous systems modernised, as our brain grew, as new structures grew on top of old structures, and all of that, to a point where now for us, we live relatively safe lives, right? I mean, I'm not really thinking the roof is actually going to fall in, fingers crossed, while I'm doing this interview, right? You're not probably worried about some wild animal ripping your arm off or somebody rushing in with a gun and killing you where you're at or whatever. We live safe lives, our food is safe, right? I'm not worried about food poisoning on the meal that I'll eat after this podcast before I'm you know, back online to talk to some more folks or anything like that. We are living fundamentally safe lives with the programming that says wait a minute, you might not be safe in this moment, right? So what happens, it basically maps over into other areas of our life and when your boss says you're fired or your spouse says I'm leaving you or whatever else it feels like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or somebody just emptied a shotgun into your chest or whatever, right? So we have sort of these inappropriate nervous system responses that are all based and grounded in survival. What happens with Fundamental Wellbeing is that there's a shift in that. So instead of the nervous system sort of cycling through and saying, hey, you know, something might not be right, right now, something might not be right right now. And the corresponding cascade of worry and anxiety and all the things that are kind of endemic in normal human society building and sitting on top of that, and rising to conscious awareness and so on, you have a sense instead that everything is fundamentally okay. Even if that's a paradox, even if your boss did just say, you know what? You're fired and I'm going to make sure you never work in this industry again, right? Or your spouse is like, I'm leaving you and I'm taking the kids and I'm taking everything, you know? These things that would normally at a surface level produce this, understandably, you know, concerns or maybe fears and worries and sadness and whatever else. So it's not that they can't still do that in Fundamental Wellbeing but deep deep down, instead of it feeling like a tiger is ripping your arm off, or a shot gun just went off into your chest, somehow, paradoxically, things seem okay. So even in extreme situations, there's this peace if you go and look for it. Then there's many, many different kinds of the experience that we can talk about from here but at its core, it's basically a rewiring in the nervous system. It is core survival, and how it deals with survival, how it looks at survival, and how it makes us feel in the moment.\n\nRufus Pollock 06:43\n\nSo in a nutshell, essentially, it's this profound shift, and to wellbeing it is fundamental; you said you picked that term, because it's at this kind of root level. It doesn't mean that you might not be appropriately reacting or feel some sadness or upset, but at a kind of root level things are okay. Whereas, otherwise, I think most human beings, we can all relate, that there's often been in our life, this fundamental sense, conversely, that things are not okay. That no matter what happens, actually, you know, things aren't. So that's that term and what is it, just to say for listeners, this is, I think, a very good secular term, but it connects with many things, and we'll talk about that maybe more later, but what are the common experiences we hear about, like, enlightenment, like people who are on that journey would also come under fundamental wellbeing, right?\n\nJeffery Martin 07:46\n\nAbsolutely, yeah. It's basically a bucket term for us and, you know, Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience was the academic term that we started off with long before Fundamental Wellbeing term days. Right. And that was basically just a term so that people would actually allow us to research them, because we were always using the wrong term before that. So someone might not like the word consciousness, or they might not like the word experience, or whatever else, but they definitely had issues with difference, you know enlightened, that's a different thing than you know, Satori, or Satori is a different thing from non dual or whatever, everybody had these favourite terms, right? And so it really does encompass all of those different areas, the peace that passeth understanding from sort of more Abrahamic type traditions, to the Satoris and the Nirvanas and the non dual experiences. Enlightenment, persistent awakening, probably the most popular term, we've surveyed a lot of these, the most popular term in the public these days in the West is really awakening. And so if somebody were to just use one word, if we weren't using Fundamental Wellbeing, if we had to pick one term, it would be really awakening. Awakening is a term that has become, in a way, the new bucket term in the public for all of these. But yeah, they sound all spiritual, that's the other thing you know, and they clearly are, from those perspectives. Those terms relate to spiritual and religious groups and sects and belief systems and philosophies and all of that, right, that have been really important cultural carriers of a knowledge of this change that can occur in humans across the rise and fall of empires, you know, I mean, when empired get wiped out somehow religions often don't, right? Philosophies and religions and whatnot, they're kind of our common cultural carriers across the rise and fall of nation states and peoples and whatever else, right. So there have been these currents through history that have carried these things forward to us, knowledge of these things forward to us. But it's important to note this is not, we don't believe, a specifically religious or spiritual type of experience. There are, in our research, many, many atheists, many agnostics that experience the same shift. So although the cultural carriers, how it's widely known in the public, are often spiritual and religious to us, all of our stuff is secular. You know, we view it as secular, we view it as a change in the nervous system.\n\nRufus Pollock 10:27\n\nSo, that's really useful, because I think we don't have a term often. And as it says, Fundamental Wellbeing doesn't have to have this spiritual aspect, but it encompasses all those experiences, or as you said, awakening might be now becoming a more common term and Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience is the other term. So how did you come to this area? You know, can you tell me a bit about your life story? Where did you start and what led you to get interested in this?\n\nJeffery Martin 11:01\n\nAbsolutely. So you know,I've been a longtime entrepreneur, technologist in the media area. And by my mid 30s, I was, in a way, out of goals, sort of out of stuff to do. And I was noticing that there are people out there that seemed to be happier than I was, which really didn't seem fair, because I felt like I had done everything that society said I was supposed to do in order to achieve happiness. And despite having plenty of money, being able to take any course that I wanted, having taken a lot of courses, having worked doggedly on myself, over the years, there were still people out there that were clearly happier than I was. And I was thinking to myself, okay, as I enter this next phase of my life, deciding what I'm going to do next, maybe it's continuing to run my companies, maybe not, what is it that really matters? If it's 20 years from now and I'm looking back and I'm like, did I make the right decision for that period of my life? What is it that I'm going to actually care about, right? And it occurred to me that I would probably care about how much wellbeing I'd experienced, how happy I was, how rich and fulfilling my life was over that period of time. And then it dawned on me, I think, quite logically, next, that if I continued down the same path, I might add another 500 million or billion dollars or something to my net worth, but that I would probably have about the same amount of wellbeing or happiness as I had in that moment. I mean, it's not like there was really any limit financially on my happiness, per se. And that really was a turning point for me. Back then I was still a hyper aggressive, hyper competitive type A type of person. And so really, what I did at that point was just set out to become the happiest person ever, right? I never set out to like, write books about this or anything like that. It was sort of like, I'm gonna win the happiness game like I'm gonna win every other game.\n\nRufus Pollock 13:07\n\nWhat job were you in at that time? What had you been doing? Like, what sort of work?\n\nJeffery Martin 13:12\n\nAt that point I was running companies and teaching. \n\nRufus Pollock 13:18\n\nWhat I mean, is were you working in wellbeing already? No, no, no. The companies spanned real estate, technology, media, those sectors. Speficially infromation technology, IT.\n\nJeffery Martin 13:39\n\nAdvertising for media. In the media, I'd moved on from like, you know, running TV stations or station groups or something like that to focusing on marketing, advertising, you know, where the money was, right?\n\nRufus Pollock 13:51\n\nWhere the money was. And so then you're like, okay, I'm going to win the happiness contetst, I'm now going to bring that energy. So what did you do next? How did you begin?\n\nJeffery Martin 14:03\n\nYeah, so I had had enough interaction over the years with academics, especially having done a lot of teaching in different environments, to realise that they were not going to be able to produce the truth. I knew I needed a research project that could produce, really, the truth, but I realised, in the academic world, the name of the game is basically grant chasing, right? And so, you know, they're gonna just basically try to get little incremental gains and publish little papers and suck as much money out of you as they can for as long as they possibly can, you know, because you're a new source of revenue for them basically. \n\nRufus Pollock 14:41\n\nThat was if you went and did grants or like commissioned research?\n\nJeffery Martin 14:44\n\nYeah, because I could have, right? I could have just, you know, said well, I'm gonna take a few million dollars and spread it around these academics and send them in this direction to go research it but I'd seen that done enough to know that that had a very low likelihood, let's just say, of leading to something actionable for my life that I wanted, unless in, you know, maybe 10 or 20 years or something down the road. And so I felt like, you know, I kind of got to do it, you know, I felt hyper intelligent, you know, I'm gonna take my 183 IQ points or whatever, and I'm going to move in this direction, right. And so I basically wound my way out of my various businesses and at the same time started to investigate what skill set I would really need in order to do this investigation, which seemed to me to be a scholarly, academic, social sciency type of, you know, skill set. So I was looking around, and when I really took a deep look at the academy at the time, it seemed like the place to be was in transdisciplinary scholarship, sort of the bleeding edge of scholarship had moved on from interdisciplinary scholarship to sort of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary being sort of, you know, you have a home discipline that you're sort of rooted in and you're exploring, you know, from there through other disciplines, and you're taking multiple lenses and the tools of multiple disciplines and whatever, but you still kind of have a home discipline. The transdisciplinary idea was emerging in Europe and it basically dealt with this notion of you don't even have a home discipline, you know, you basically just learn how to do valid research across disciplines and sort of take the best of each discipline in a way that you can defend the research at the end of it, and all of that, and so I'm like, okay, that is probably as good as it's gonna get on the scholarship side. So I thought where can I learn that, I thought I would probably have to go to Europe since I, you know, mostly speak English, I mean I do speak French a little bit, but I didn't think it would be enough to really, you know, make it through a French programme. And so I was thinking there were some great programmes on this in the UK and whatnot, right? So I was thinking, okay, I'm probably gonna have to go to the UK. Same time, my parents are old, you know, I'm thinking, well, you know, do I really want to be stuck in some PhD programme or something, in, you know, the UK and my dad dies or something like that, right? So I've got these thoughts going on in the back of my head, and then, almost like miraculously, a guy named Alfonso Montuori, who was totally into this transdisciplinary world, was mostly European, I can't remember the cultures he's from but he's from like multiple European cultures and his parents were like diplomats and stuff for different countries or something, he basically starts a programme in transdisciplinary scholarship at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and, like, picks the leading consciousness researcher in this whole non symbolic area, Allan Combs, to be on the faculty of it. So I was like, thank you Universe, and it's a distance programme, so I don't even have to really change my life, I mean, who has a distance PhD programme back then, right? Nobody. And so I don't even have to really change my life.\n\nRufus Pollock 18:01\n\nWhen was this?\n\nJeffery Martin 18:07\n\nI think it started in 2006. And I found out about it like two weeks before it started and basically begged my way into the programme at the last minute. So I'm in this programme on transdisciplinary scholarship, and it is fantastic and it has a lot of Europeans in it teaching remotely because they don't actually have to be in San Francisco and all of that. And then at a certain point, I realised, okay, I really need hardcore psychology and neuroscience to explore this, not just the sort of mixed methods type of research that is being taught on the transdisciplinary side of things, I really needed serious empirical education for that side of the mixed methods piece. And I basically started looking around for where I might be able to get that and I wound up at the same time that I was in the Ph. D. programme, going to another programme at Harvard, to pick up the psychology and neuroscience piece. What I was really just trying to do is get myself to have the sharpest possible toolset to collect the data that I wanted, to sift the data that I wanted, I figured it would probably take me a couple years, you know, to acquire the skillset, to do the research and then, you know, hopefully to join whoever I found were the happiest people out there. That was my goal, find the happiest people, research the happiest people, become one of the happiest people, go back to building companies, right? Obviously, it didn't turn out that way. 17 years or 18 years later and here we are now.\n\nRufus Pollock 19:40\n\nFast forward a little bit. So you're working with Allan Combs, you're working at the California Institute for Integral Studies, and where did your investigation start? What did you actually start doing in your investigation? Once you've got your tools, what were you starting to investigate?\n\nJeffery Martin 20:05\n\nI was really just trying to find the happiest people out there. And I had an inkling, the reason Allan was interesting to me was because I've done some research before this, now I wasn't a scholar before this, right, I had masters degrees in management and stuff like that and technology and things. So I had like business level and technology level research skills, like professional level, research skills. When I turned those on the problem of happiness after I had kind of given up on there being a way for me to buy it from someone else teaching it to me, in the few years before this, and what I was really looking at was the self help movement. You know, I'm thinking, this is a multibillion dollar movement, every year people are buying billions of dollars in self help stuff. How's that going? Are there successful clues in the public self help world that can tell me how to get happier. And so I'd actually done a lot of work in that over the previous few years. And that had taken me to this realization that there was this whole other level, potentially, of human wellbeing that really hadn't been seriously explored, wasn't being seriously explored, wasn't likely to be seriously explored, because there was just no future in it if you wanted to be a scientist, or an academic. And that was these sort of mystical, or, you know, spiritually attained, or whatever, types of consciousness. And so of course, I'd come across Allan's books, and his expertise and the fact that he was, you know, sort of at the centre of the academic universe on that in many ways, not the Christian version of it, but sort of more the Eastern version of it, more Ralph Hood, I'd say, was more at the centre of it who was also on my dissertation committee in the end. And so yeah, so that was the story.\n\nRufus Pollock 21:59\n\nSo to recap that, you'd already had this inkling, and it is an intriguing fact, that obviously there's this huge self help movement. And there's something maybe about, you know, like in a way self help sometimes is positioned almost at the top of Maslow's pyramid, self actualization to some extent. And in England, there's stuff out there that's beyond that, the transcendental model. Where were you starting the empirical part of this was then? What did you start doing which then led you on your journey to where you are today? You started interviewing people, or what did you do? \n\nJeffery Martin 22:50\n\nYeah so I knew that I was stepping into a hornets' nest by wanting to research this. Maslow, the very famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, once one time head of the American Psychological Association, sort of leading association in the world for this kind of thing. He died on like June 6th, I think, 1970, which was like six days before I was born. So possibly he just went straight into my mom's womb, and here we are, and just continuing his work or something, who knows, right? But basically, in the last period of his life, he had this heart attack and from that heart attack, he basically himself transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing and became very interested in it. Up untill then he was known for work on meaning, work on peak experiences, the self actualization stuff that you talked about. But he had this profound persistent transition in his own experience of the world, very late in his life, and unfortunately at a point where he was not really in a physical position to push it out into the broader academic world, broader Academy. So what he did is he basically started a new form of psychology called transpersonal psychology, largely with another guy named Tony Sutich. And then he dies and transpersonal psychology basically wanders very far away at that point from Maslow's original view of it; this psychedelic thing comes on, it goes off into that, it goes off into dreams and shamanism and all sorts of stuff. What Maslow really just kind of wanted to study was what he called this plateau experience. You know, he had studied peak experiences, so he called this the high plateau, basically, just to keep it in his metaphor. And, you know, that's great. But what happened as a result of that, is that you wound up having transpersonal psychology and this whole area of study get associated with all kinds of super weird and incredibly non rigorous research, to the point where people like Ralph Hood tried to get the Transpersonal Psychology Association into the APA as one of its subgroups, and there's a lot of subgroups in the APA so that shouldn't be some Herculean task, and they were just like, there's no way we're considering anything there for inclusion, you know, in our rubber stamp of valid research and psychology and whatever else, right? And so it had really been through a rough period, and I knew that, and now I'm coming along saying, well, I want to pick up that research ball, right? So I knew that I was on the wrong side of every possible ounce of politics in the mainstream Academy. And what I did was I just started going around to people, and asking, you know, hey, if you wanted to look into this, how would you do it? Luminaries, you know, in the field, people that were very well politically positioned, some of whom had an interest in this, some of them didn't have an interest in this. And then I just did exactly what they recommended, because I wanted to be able to later go back and say, well, if you're going to poop on this research, and these outcomes, hey, they were done exactly the way you told me to do them. So, I was basically very, sort of, politically oriented, again, type A right? You know, company builder, all that, right? So what they said was go and survey a bunch of people, basically the consensus, what most of them said was like, start to get your arms around them and see if they're different from ordinary people, or if they're delusional, or if they have psychopathology or whatever, go give them a whole bunch of standardised, gold standard psychology measures, across all kinds of things, you know, see where they're at developmentally, see where they're at psychopathologically, see where they're at in terms of wellbeing, see where they're at in terms of blah, blah, blah, personality, etc, right? So that's exactly what we did. And actually, it was really disappointing because when we got that data back, they turned out to look pretty normal; they were happy, they weren't anxious, or depressed, or anything. But there wasn't anything in that initial set of data that was like, look, this is a distinct population in humanity that warrants further study.\n\nRufus Pollock 27:05\n\nHow did you find them that to start with? How did what how did you find very happy people?\n\nJeffery Martin 27:13\n\nThat cost a lot of money, initially. Originally, I thought the main barrier to this project is that the people who could do it, who have an interest in it and who might be willing to do it on nights and weekends, basically believe that there's like six of these people in the world, at any given time and their odds of actually getting to them and researching them are non existent. And then the general, you know, crowd, there just wasn't any money to go and build a participant population there. And so, that was another thing I asked, what makes a legitimate research subject as I'm beginning this project, and they basically boiled down to three criteria from the advice from those folks, those luminary type folks, and they warned me, like, it's going to be a tough road to hoe, you need criteria that you can sort of go across these different groups. One of the criteria, for instance, was that they were from an established system that had something like Fundamental Wellbeing in it, it didn't have to be an end goal of it, it could have been just in its mystical aspects or whatever else, but that had to be really well defined in terms of what it was. So an established system, with well defined criteria, that groups of people that are, you know, reasonably knowledgeable on those criteria, could look at someone and say, that person is there. \n\nRufus Pollock 28:40\n\nSo what you were looking for, just to play this back and you explain it for listeners, what you were saying is to do good empirical research, you need a couple of things. So one is you're goning to need a way to then assess people, like to find out what was different about them, but then the toughest problem was actually finding a research population, or at least rigorous research, which was also having criteria for identifying people in Fundamental Wellbeing, that was not like fully objective, but at least there was like criteria and there was a community of practice that would kind of validate those criteria. \n\nJeffery Martin 29:19\n\nThose individuals specifically, not just the criteria, but the individuals as having met the criteria.\n\nRufus Pollock 29:27\n\nRight. Okay. So, you know, they've experienced in oneness or other behaviours, okay. So that was one thing, so you'd find a community probably, maybe a traditional religious one that has that, what were the other two?\n\nJeffery Martin 29:38\n\nNo, that was really sort of the heart of it, right, is that they had to have those three components: so it's an established tradition with rules and then people agreeing that a person fits the rules that are within the tradition and that are a valid enough group that could judge that. And that is basically the idea.\n\nRufus Pollock 30:03\n\nAnd then you said it was pretty expensive to find them, you said that was the most costly part. Tell me about that. Yeah, I really was. Because these people are scattered all over the world, they're hard to reach, they're hard to even get in contact with in the first place, and then to try to get to participate in some sort of scientific study of them and where they're at, they often believe science can't study you. And so, you know, we had to put money into building lists of potential people to contact which took, you know, hiring staff to find those people and create even just an initial list of people to contact. Then you have to contact them. And then you have to keep contacting them, because they don't contact you back, they just ignore you. And so you have to have a cycle of contact, you have to try to put yourself in their path, whenever possible, figure out where they're at, different events that you might be able to run into them at, fly to those events, try to hope that you cross them in the hall and get 10 seconds to introduce yourself to them. I mean, the early phase of this project was like that kind of thing. You know, it was a lot of just trying to get people to participate that had almost no interest and looking at their whole existence through some sort of scientific lens, that they were pretty sure was just going to determine that they were invalid, that something about their experience was crazy or invalid or whatever else, and you know, why give this person the time so that they can even build that up. It took a lot of trust building in those early periods, you know, to even get people; a lot of relationship building. And then once we did sit down with them, I would say the the early interviews were rough, we didn't really know what we should be asking. So after we went from the psychology measures, which are a little bit easier to get people to fill out, right, because they can just do it on their own time and they don't have to give you a day of their time for an interview, or anything like that, when that didn't really show anything and we started switching over to in-person interviews, then you have a whole bigger ask, right? Because you're really asking people for more or less a day of their time to sit down with you in a long format interview - we started with trying to do some short interviews and we really quickly realised that wasn't going to work out - and then we were sort of struggling early on with just our interview format and stuff. And it occurred to us that where we really wanted to head with this was probably to some sort of neuroscience. And so what we should do is view this as the early part of a neuroscience type experiment. And oftentimes what you do in the early part of neuroscience, is you sort of interview people along the lines of cognitive science, you know, cognition affect, perception, memory, stuff like that. And so we started to then take our interviews in a semi-structured way in the direction of more of these cognitive science type things. And that really wound up being, in a way, the jewel in the crown, it was totally accidental, you know, but it kind of was the jewel in the crown of the first phase of the research. Because what it did, without us thinking about it, was that it forced everybody to have our language, to adopt our language. So instead of being able to sit there and talk about God, or spaciousness, or you know, consciousness or whatever, they were answering questions directly about their cognition, affect, perception, memory, eventually sense of self in a very patterned, rigorous, digging down into it, but psychological, phenomenological, from a psychological standpoint kind of way. And what that allowed us to do is compare the data across subjects. I think if we hadn't done that, if we had kept up a looser thing, where we just started to let people talk however they wanted to talk about that experience it would have been impossible to compare people's experience. There's been plenty of dissertations done like that, and little research projects done with like, you know, six, eight, twelve, two, one, sometimes, participants, you know, and it's really hard to do a thematic analysis of that stuff, and to figure out what people were talking about and where they might relate to each other and whatnot. But by forcing people into that cognitive science lens, it accomplished that really, really well. And suddenly, we were able to really compare subjects quite reliably. You know, either you had the same quantity of thoughts, or you didn't, either they had the same emotional salience, or they didn't, you know, those are very basic, high level things. But you get the idea. Yeah, let's just do this. Let's say you're talking to someone, you know, maybe these are people who are in a particular tradition, whether it's Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, who are we might call awakened or something like that, and what you're saying is, normally, if you've got to interview them which is valuable discussion about their experience. The difficulty is that, to be honest, to the science audience it could sound kind of woowoo, maybe it isn't, but it can sound that way, but you also have no structure, just so I'm getting this for myself and for the audience is, what you're saying is cognitive science or cognition, just to break that down for people listening, is like, how you think; when you're having thoughts, what kind of thoughts you're having, are you able to do planning, are you able to do certain kinds of cognition? And then you're saying, affect is kind of, just sort of, like,\n\nJeffery Martin 37:10\n\nEmotion, that kind of thing. Yeah.\n\nRufus Pollock 37:12\n\nYeah. So what you're say is you had this structure, and by having that structure, and quite a kind of down to earth structure, you can ask questions, like, are you having as many thoughts as you used to? Or do you experience strong emotions or not? And roughly at that early point, what were you immediately starting to notice about people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing?\n\nJeffery Martin 37:36\n\nWell, we noticed that they were really obvious significant similarities across them. So for instance, everyone in those earliest days reported a reduction in thoughts. You know, they could all remember a sort of before and after, right, that was one of the things that we would pick up on. Our interviews had a very specific format to them, for the first 30 minutes or so we would just kind of casually chat with them, get some background on them, try to get them to think about the before and after, whether there was a before and after moment for them, multiple before and after moments, so we could sort of start to get that. And we would synchronise our language to them, so if they used awareness, we'd use awareness, right, things like that, at the beginning, and then we would slowly tune them increasingly into our sort of psychological, phenomenological, cognitive science-based language over time. But we had to sort of hook them with some raport in a way, and then, you know, pull them in. And so we find, for instance, on cognition, is that universally before and after the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing, in those early days, there was a reported reduction in thought, and often people would say things like \"all thought went away\", or something like that. And then as we would wind down further into the cognition piece, eventually what we would get to, again, across people, was a realisation that well, all their thoughts didn't really go away, I mean, they can still think about what they have to do, you know, after this interview, or things like that, what really went away were self-reflexive thoughts. Right? They had a tremendous reduction in self reflexive or self reflective, if you want to think of it that way, thought. But other areas of thought, you know, were still there, untouched and it just turns out that for the average person, the vast majority of thoughts in our head all day are self-reflective thoughts in some way, right? And so if the bottom falls out of those, suddenly, it's like, wow, all my thoughts went away. And so, you know, we would start off with a claim, like, all my thoughts went away, and then just relentlessly dig into that, to see if actually really there are no thoughts in this person's head at all, and so on. And so we would do that across that, we would do that across emotions. There was a spectrum of things in those early days around emotion. At a minimum, people said that their negative emotions would fall off much more rapidly. And so you know, they might have something happen that triggered some psychological conditioning or something, but it would go away much more rapidly than was ever the case in the past. And that went on a spectrum from that all the way to people insisting that, you know, they didn't have triggers anymore, and that they really didn't perceive any emotion at all, in their system. And so we saw a gradient between those two polls, if you will, right. And then with memory, most people didn't really have significant memory effects. It was common for people to say, you know, my memory is like, nothing, it's like shot, it's nothing compared to what it used to be. But then, you know, we would test that, if you're with someone for 10/12 hours, you can be like, hey, you know, earlier in the day, and they can remember that with no problem where you were, what you were eating when you were out to eat together, you know, or who was around, you know, okay, well, your memory is clearly intact, why are you telling me you don't have a memory, or you got these memory problems, right? And that led us to realise that memories just weren't spontaneously really occurring for them anymore. And, you know, before Fundamental Wellbeing, there's like, all kinds of living in the past, and all these thoughts that are constantly coming up from the past and stuff like that. And that wasn't happening, you know, with this population, they were just assuming, man my memory is just shot, but it's actually that there just weren't stimulus probes happening to bring those memories up and there's some sort of change in their internal architecture, you know, around memories just naturally arising all the time, you know, throughout the day. And so there were things like that, examples like that.\n\nRufus Pollock 41:48\n\nWow. Okay. And I think just also I want to flag this for ourselves and for listeners, what's amazing in a way about this, and it's so obvious, is we've moved from what would otherwise be very incomparable experiences, to things that start to be very noticeable, like a reduction in thoughts. What I'm also hearing is that often there was a strong before and after, there was strong changes that were noticeable around their waking up experiences. So I think that's really amazing. And at this point, how many people had you talked to at the end of this first phase?\n\nJeffery Martin 42:42\n\nThe first phase lasted for a number of years. In the earliest phase of interviewing the main spiritual teachers and stuff like that, I would say by the time we were through the first 30 of them or so, patterns were starting to emerge and it was clear that this was not a unified landscape, that there wasn't just one experience of this. These ranges were increasingly getting filled out, like the emotion thing, you know, a couple of people insistant that they have no emotion, and other people that clearly do have a mix of positive and negative emotions and some people that have a single emotion that feels like a combination of love and joy and compassion, and maybe some other things mixed in, you know, culturally. There were these very clear buckets - at the time we called them buckets that we were sort of seeing emerge in the data - and so we could tell, okay, enlightenment isn't just enlightenment, so to speak. There's a landscape here that's starting to emerge within the first 30 people, which were really the hardcore spiritual people that was very, very, very evident. And you're right, it was Christians, it was Islamic people, Sufis, it was Islam people, it was Buddhists, it was even some shamanic type, indigenous type, spiritual people. And so it was a range across the different belief systems and whatnot, we were very careful not to centre on one, not to just centre on the east. We wanted to sample as broad a range of this as we could, in those early days, especially. \n\nRufus Pollock 44:34\n\nAnd I want to ask one other question on that, the other thing that intrigued me in looking at your work previously was that also you started to come across people who were not in any system, people who'd somehow, as it were, transitioned into Fundamental Wellbeing, and who weren't Christian, Buddhist or anything. When did you come across someone like that, where you were like oh this is something than can happen without even being in a classic religious or spiritual tradition. When did you come across that?\n\nJeffery Martin 45:07\n\nYou know what started to happen was, very little on the on the Western religious front, but in the Eastern religious front, we would build these really strong raports, you know, people enjoyed sitting down with us after we went through the first, you know, five or 10, or something, interviews, or whatever, and we're starting to get a handle on what areas to probe and things like that, and they enjoy that because the self-reflexive thought is basically gone and you have someone sitting in front of you that's asking really awesome questions, you really appreciate the stimulus probe in your system, right? And oftentimes, you know, we'd ask a question, and someone would just have to sit there quietly, sort of searching their own experience, nobody ever asked them that before, nobody had asked these people cognitive science-based questions. And so to them, it was like a fantastic self-learning experience sitting down with us, right, and it built a lot of very positive rapport and people began to really confide things in us. And one of the things that started to be confided in us here and there, were people, mostly at that time from Eastern, maybe one from a Western tradition, but mostly from Eastern traditions, that were saying things like, \"I'm not really religious anymore, I have left the belief system that I'm embedded in, that might even be providing my income, that I might be a venerated figure in, or whatever else, you know, I've kind of left that behind. As I've moved deeper into this, that has just not seemed to really fit my current experience and I've chosen to keep exploring and keep deepening kind of off the map, I've had to leave my tradition to do that.\" And so we've been prepared for the reality that we would probably run into people who had never been in a religious or spiritual system. And yet, we're still experiencing this, because, over time, we just kept meeting more and more people who had left that behind. Eventually we reached a point where we felt comfortable broadening the criteria for samples, right. And so you didn't have to be a spiritual leader from some tradition where people were agreeing that you met the criteria, or whatever, we felt like, okay, we have enough data now. And nobody's ever asked these questions to other people before, right? So if they're in there answering the questions, they're not falling into the pattern in the direction of the data collection that we've done so far, so we just assure ourselves that they're not someone who should be involved as a participant. And if they are, then they probably should be involved, or could be potentially, involved as a participant, right? So there came a day that we began to broaden out that criteria and that's when other people could come in to the project that weren't from a specific religion, that weren't from a tradition, and where we did start to have atheists, agnostics, you know, that type of thing coming in.\n\nRufus Pollock 48:17\n\nSo just a sample. Basically, you're then able, at some point, almost to bootstrap. Having given a sample that came out of maybe a religious tradition, you know, enlightened or whatever we'd call it, you then have these criteria, so into like the reduction in thoughts, this emotional behaviour, that you could use to look more generally, and maybe to put out surveys. And because it's also not fakeable, there's no reason people would be reporting these things for any other reason. So what you're saying is that you could kind of bootstrap into now starting to have a pattern. I think this is something just for the listeners to really get which is, you're then starting to have a kind of useful, I don't want to say fingerprint, but it's more for people to look for themselves. You're starting to have this kind of criteria, secular criteria, in the sense of while connected to religious tradition, but not with any specific one, of what it looks like to be in Fundamental Wellbeing. And you've mentioned, you know, massive reduction in narrative self, either negative emotional valence being reduced or an ability to transition out of negative emotion very quickly, in some way or other things you've described. Just to flag for listeners, Jeffrey writes more about this in his papers and in his Finders book, and so on which will be in the show notes. I just want to then come back, how then, just to ask, how did you find more people? Did you start putting out a survey on, you know, Google ads? How did you find more people?\n\nJeffery Martin 49:49\n\nWe didn't use Google ads. In hindsight, we probably should have. And I had done quite a bit with Google Ads almost since the beginning so that wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility. What we really just started to do was talk to people, was go out and give talks to groups, speak at events, you know, things like that. And that would basically trickle more people in. Also, research subjects generally would know one or two other people who were in Fundamental Wellbeing, and they would almost always refer them to us because, you know, we were so fun to talk to, or so helpful, basically, to help them with probing their own experiences as just a function of us collecting our data. And so they would almost be, you know, talking to their handful of others that they knew and being like, you've got to go sit down with this guy, you know, kind of thing. So that really helped. It was a lot of snowballing from that standpoint. And then a friend of mine who is a business partner of mine, we owned a number of companies together over the years, named Rod Pennington, he's also a pretty major fiction author. He's ghostwritten some really amazing books that we can't say who they are on the fiction side and the nonfiction side, you know, needless to say, he's a New York Times bestselling author who is not a New York Times bestselling author, probably several times over, right? He said to me, you know, why don't we just write a fiction book. And, you know, he's like, I'll just write a fiction book about, you know, this stuff in general and we'll put a little thing in it and we'll see, you know, who contacts you and maybe that's a way to broaden out into the sort of more mainstream. And so we did that, we wrote a book called The Fourth Awakening, which was, I think, frankly, a really good book. It pulled together a lot of the stuff, it's only marginally a fiction book, frankly, you know, we threw a lot of stuff in there, real people can recognise themselves a little bit. And that book became really popular, it sold a lot of copies. We self published it, you know, we didn't run it through a publisher or anything, because we just wanted to get it right out. So we threw it up on Amazon and I stopped tracking it years ago, when it was at like, half a million copies sold. It just kept selling. And so a lot of people, you know, then sort of found out about our research, actually, that were just interested from that fiction book and contacted us. And in fact, we used that fiction book list, when we did our first experiments on our ourselves trying to transition and get before and after data. Right now, all we've been talking about is the the period where we were collecting the data where the people were already in Fundamental Wellbeing, obviously, the day comes in any research project, where you think to yourself, let's see if we can measure the changes, right? And it was the mailing list from that book that we sent out to, to say, hey, anybody want to actually try getting? We distilled down I think, I can't remember, maybe 27 people that seemed really serious, that contacted us, that met pre criteria, and then from there picked six of them. So it was a fiction book that really allowed us to get out more broadly. But we were doing a lot of speaking, a lot of interviews, a lot of other stuff. We would never give away the questions, even in an academic conference environment, because those questions were the thing that allowed us to screen, you know, if we gave out the questions and the answers, then you could come to us, and you could fool us. But because nobody had ever asked this stuff, nobody knew the patterns of answers, or the specific language in the answers or anything like that, even as we were publishing preprints of papers and circulating stuff, you know, I remember Stan Krippner, one of the great consciousness researchers of our time, saying to me, you know, Jeffery, you've got to put some quotes from these people in this paper that you're circulating, and I'm like, can't do it, you know, because then people will be able to fool us, you know, the quotes are going to have to wait until a lot later in this research. And so that really held true for a very long time.\n\nRufus Pollock 54:12\n\nOkay, so at this point, this is, what five years into your project or something? \n\nJeffery Martin 54:22\n\nSix, seven, a few years.\n\nRufus Pollock 54:25\n\nYeah, yeah. Because at some point, you've got enough data, and then I think we're coming towards the first Finders programme, I'd like to talk about that. You said you're interested in, when you mentioned these six people, you had this moment, like, maybe we can build a protocol that can help people actually transition to Fundamental Wellbeing. Is that right? Is that what I'm understanding from what you were just alluding to when you said about the book list? Could you say a bit about that?\n\nJeffery Martin 54:54\n\nYeah, basically, you know, the first few years we're doing all this interview stuff. So from say 2006 to 2009 or so, at the end of 2009, we're thinking to ourselves, you know, we're not getting a lot of new data from sitting down with people. We've done some physiological data collection, some EEG, some breath data, some heart rate data, GSR data, stuff like that, during that period, kind of sporadically, just exploratory. Then we started working more with neuroscience partners, trying to interest people with FMRI machines, especially really cutting edge FMRI machines that could do real time feedback and stuff like that, which was pretty new back then, very new back then, into this research population, which we had some success doing at different places around the world. And you know, some people are already doing it like Zoran Josipovic at NYU was already on this path, was already doing it, we didn't need to be like, hey, Zoran, would you consider scanning some of these people or whatever. So it wasn't like our idea to do this, you know Zoran was doing it, acouple of other people had done a little bit of stuff in the space. So we went through a neuroscience phase that sort of helped us to understand what was going on, change-wise, in the brain, initially at a high level over time. And then about probably 2012-2013, we started thinking about collecting pre and post data. You know, it's sort of like the neuroscience thing had kind of run its course, like we learned what we could learn from the interviews, we learned what we could learn from brain scans, and EEG and stuff and now it's sort of like, until we can really get pre and post data we just can't take this to the next level. And so we started asking ourselves, do we know any methods that work for people, reliably? I mean, if you're thinking like, I'm going to spend $2,500 a research subject or something to do some FMRI study on them, right, you can't have, you know, 99% of people not getting there. That's just a recipe for bankrupting a study. And so our first question was really like, do we have any idea how to actually get people there? And frankly we didn't.\n\nRufus Pollock 56:53\n\nThere being Fundamental Wellbeing? One thing, just to make it obvious for people on this call, you know, it may be obvious to you but I just want to flag, I might have in my life have seen some people who are just born happy; some people are just born lucky. Something that I assume you haven't mentioned, but you would have learnt from your first set of subjects, or people you talk to, was that they hadn't always been like this, or some of them maybe had been, but can I take that as one thing that we've almost said unsaid, that there have been times?\n\nJeffery Martin 57:01\n\nYeah, Fundamental Wellbeing, exactly.\n\nRufus Pollock 57:05\n\nYeah, for sure. There are a very tiny number of people who always seem to be in this. Like the thing that happens to the rest of us around age two and a half to three and a half doesn't happen to them and they just have spent their whole life in Fundamental Wellbeing, but that's a vanishingly small number of people. Okay. But so many people in your early interviews had reported some kind of transition or whatever, it had taken several experiences, but they had a real before and after. And that's the thing, I think, also is a really big insight, I know it comes out of many traditions, but what you want to flag is that Fundamental Wellbeing is both something that can kind of be, I don't want to say secularised, but you can see these criteria and things that really affect the quality of your life. and it is kind of this transition and often it's not gradual, I get from many of your people, it had been quite rapid at some point.\n\nJeffery Martin 58:27\n\nIt was about 70%, instant, 30% gradual in that early population of 1200 people, during those early years.\n\nRufus Pollock 58:35\n\nAnd for them, also, what you're getting is, it's kind of noticeable if it happens to you. \n\nJeffery Martin 58:39\n\nEven if it's gradual, you still realise. Interestingly, you can not notice it initially, because you have such a drop off and self reflective block, right? And after the transition, you're not like constantly analysing what's going on with you, or whether you're happy or whether someone likes the blue jacket that I'm wearing, or, you know, all of that neuroticism just sort of goes away. So, you actually kind of miss that you've transitioned to this. And even like super famous people told us like, you know, they didn't notice it sometimes for weeks or months afterward, and then they'd be like, you know, pontificating on it in some, you know, religious environment where they were considered an expert on it, even though they hadn't gotten there yet, but they were like, some senior teacher or something, right. And they're like, checking off in their mind the boxes, and at some point, they're like, Oh, I wonder when that happened? So it's kind of a funny aside.\n\nRufus Pollock 59:34\n\nThat is very funny. So yeah, people could not notice. And to come back then, you were then starting to look, if we want to understand more about what's going on, we really would like to find situations where people actually transition. \n\nJeffery Martin 59:51\n\nAnd measure them before and after. \n\nRufus Pollock 59:53\n\nAnd I'm almost hearing that you came up with the protocol or a way of trying to support people doing that, because otherwise, you'd have to like be with lots of people and like most of them wouldn't transition, and there's no kind of predictable way. And that's one of the things I want to ask about because you could be like, oh, wouldn't it be easy? Why wouldn't you just go to some of these gurus and say, like, just find me some of your students, surely some of them are going to wake up in the next few months. One of the things that you'd maybe been seeing was that that wasn't generally the case, that people reliably transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing, even in these spiritual traditions, it was a bit more random, even there, is that right?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:00:32\n\nAlmost nobody transitioned, you know, and we had really well known spiritual teachers, when we would ask for a referral to some of their students to participate in the research, who would confide in us that they're not sure anybody ever woke up from, you know, their teachings, we learned that this was considered one of the most frustrating professions out there, if you weren't in Fundamental Wellbeing, it's hard to imagine that you could keep doing this day in and day out, because it was just, you know, having very little actual impact in terms of the transition to fundamental well being on people. And folks were kind of puzzled by that. You know, I remember even later in the research after I talked about these kinds of things, a pretty well known guy in sort of the modern, non duelists sort of space, when I was travelling in Europe, one time, we had dinner, or we hung out at night, I think maybe we didn't have dinner, maybe we just hung out after dinner at his hotel room or something like that, I remember him saying, look, you know, I mean, I've basically directly, forget about classes, people coming to see me, I've directly worked with 1000s of people, I can't remember if it was 5000 or 7000 people, I had an actual number. And he's like, as far as I know, no one has ever transitioned that I've worked with, he's like, you know, what can you tell me about what I can do differently? And I'm like, well, I can tell you that's normal. You're in good company, you know, your competitors in the spiritual space aren't like, you know, really lapping you on this one, right. And we had a great conversation about it. I mean, these types of conversations were not uncommon, you know. And so the problem for us in that when wanting to measure people before and after was, despite our global reach at this point, there wasn't any place that we could think to go, where it had, you know, enough of a hit rate, to justify paying for them to be in a scanner beforehand and then, you know, just having thrown away that 700 bucks, or whatever it would have cost, you know, for the scanner time,\n\nRufus Pollock 1:02:38\n\nI do just want to flag this Jeffery because I think also for listeners, for those interested, you know, obviously, you could pick up a book, I could pick an example, like Culadasa's book, which people might know, The Mind Illuminated, a classic guide to at least Buddhist meditation. And at the beginning it's kind of like, look, if you really do this, well, the Dalai Lama reckons you could do this in a year. There is this tendency to be like, just do the meditations right in this particular practice. So I just want to flag this point, which is that that insight is quite significant, I think, and I think this may have to run into a second interview, potentially, but even at this point, I want to come to it, that is a really significant point, because there is a tendency in a lot of the teaching of a tradition lik just do the meditation practices right and, you know, in like a year, you know, you should be able to get to level 10. There's an incredible frustration that you often don't, and maybe a surprise that also things aren't highly effective. And I think there's also the tendency that it is so amazing when it does occur for people, they're just like, well I was just doing that if you just do that particular mantra, or you do this particular thing, or just do this extreme sport, and, you know, whatever it is, there's a tendency to perhaps extrapolate, over extrapolate from one's own experience, particularly also once when in Fundamental Wellbeing I think there's a haziness about the prior period of the journey. You  came to this because you were looking to look at before and after.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:04:30\n\nThe thing to think about with this, right, is that in most Eastern traditions, that's okay. And in Western traditions, to some degree too, in Western traditions, you just sort of generally have to be right with God to get to the right heaven, right. And so if you don't actually have a mystical union experience with it, but you're, you know, you're pious and devout or whatever, that's an okay way to spend your life. On the eastern side, you've always got more lifetimes, right? And so there isn't really an expectation of a lot of success on the Eastern tradition side of thinks, right? So it's only in sort of like a new non dualish sort of guy like the one that I gave an example of that they're bothered by this, you know. If you're steeped in Hinduism or Buddhism, it's just sort of like, well, of course, nobody's making that much progress because you make progress over 1000s of lifetimes. So I think you do have to put that frame, it's not like there's some ethical problem for them, like, you know, they're out there saying this, and it's not producing the result, they're assuming it's going to produce results over many lifetimes. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:04:30\n\nYes, there's even a sense, I think, in many traditions, we have to be careful here, that it can be like kind of grasping after things, it can become like another thing on the list like, I think you jokingly referred to yourself at the beginning like, you know, I aced everything else now I'm going to ace well being. And obviously, there's this kind of subtilty, but to come to it then, you were coming to look at it before and after. The protocol, what brought you towards like looking at creating a structure to support people in transition?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:06:09\n\nWe just wanted to collect AB data, you know, we just wanted to collect before and after data, that was our only real impetus.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:06:16\n\nSo what happened? So tell me a bit, you found six people from your list? And what was it you created? Tell us a bit about this.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:06:23\n\nWe tried a whole bunch of stuff, you know, beforehand, before the six people, long before those six people, we tried all sorts of brain zapping methods, things like that. That was before our ultrasound work that we're doing now, which is a lot better, and more accurate. But those technologies didn't exist back then. So we just tried a bunch of different things. And none of them really worked. We tried to look around and see, well, who's a teacher who might have a higher hit rate, maybe they can, but just none of it really ever worked. And then we did something that probably, you know, anyone listening to this podcast is going to be like, seems like they should have done that first. But we didn't do it first. We basically poured back through the data, and there was a question in the intake form, you know, what transitioned you? Now you would think that like, that would be the first answer that we read, right, if we were trying to answer this question, but you have to realise we didn't really think that the subject population at the time had a really good handle on insight into themselves or, you know, it just didn't seem like that was going to be a usable answer, frankly, from people. And so we have a lot of data, still have a lot of data, that we've never had time to process. And that was a question that we just never processed. Well, somebody did process it, a research assistant did go back through those surveys, did process that out. And it turned out that there was actually relatively few things that people said worked for them. And there was another question, what have you tried? And it turns out that when you compare the two questions, people have tried a lot of the same stuff, but it wasn't the same thing that had worked across different individuals, right. And so that gave us a clue that what we might actually have is a) a good method problem and, b) a matching problem among the good methods. And that basically became, eventually, the protocol that we tried, I think in 2014, I believe it was in January, February 2014, when we did that first six person experiment. What we did was we basically, by that point we'd been experimenting with the protocol on an individual by individual basis, just kind of around the lab and the research centre and stuff before that. And we learned that there are different types of these methods. So let's say there's like half a dozen general categories of methods, we have since collapsed that down to five categories of methods, but at the time it was like half a dozen categories of methods.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:08:42\n\nFor listeners, just what do you mean by method?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:08:45\n\nSo, you know, for instance, it might be a meditation method, like a mantra-based method, right? We've learned that, you know, most mantra-based methods don't transition people, there's, you know, some subsets of some very specific types of mantra methods that do. And so even within, again if I just say mantra method, right, it's not like go just try a mantra method and that's guaranteed to be some gold standard method. It's not, there's a lot of nuance in this. So it can be mantra methods, it can be something more modern like a direct inquiry, who am I type of thing. It could be even more modern than that like Douglas Harding's headless way type stuff carried on by Richard Lang in the UK, which I would consider more of a cognitive science-based exercise and so there are just these different things that had actually you know, shifted people and we put them into a single protocol on a certain way that I know we don't have time for right now because I'm watching the clock tick down.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:09:43\n\nSo just as like almost a trailer and we will wrap soon, in a trailer of that, so you saw these different methods and you put them together and like you had this matching problem, so it was a question, what are good methods. And then the point, which you said, I think is also a really big insight for listeners, and anyone interested, and obviously you can find more in Jeffery's work and the course 45 days to awakening, which I highly recommend. But the basic point was that you have good methods, but any given method only works for certain people, that's what you mean by matching, is that right?\n\nJeffery Martin 1:10:20\n\nExactly, exactly. And so, it's not enough to have a list, with instructions even from the best form of these gold standard type of methods that are most likely to work on a small percentage of people, let's say 3% of people, or 4% of people, I mean, if you've got a method that works on 3 or 4%, of people reliably, you've invented one of the best methods ever, you know, that is an enormously successful method and hit rate. Can you imagine going to a retreat and having 3 or 4% of people transition reliably in a retreat around you like, that's unheard of, like, who experiences that in the retreats that they go to, right? And so you know, you're talking about very small percentage success rates. But that's what makes a great method. And then, within that, learning to sequence them a certain way, so, you know, learning that it's better to have people do one before another one and then you can increase success rates. And so there's some experimentation with that, learning how to tweak methods based on knowledge of modern brains, and brain science and stuff like that kind of drag them into a modern era, maybe they were really great for brains that had an attention system in the 1600s, or something, but now we need them to work for something that has an attention system from, you know, 2022, as an example, right, so tweaks to them very subtle tweaks, oftentimes, but very important tweaks. And so we did all of those things and we sort of tuned the methods up as best we could, but even with that, and with all of the psychological data that we had from people, which was a lot, because people put out a lot of these surveys, a lot of those gold standards. like she said, one thing that we didn't mention is that we would just keep sending people these surveys until they told us to stop, that they just didn't want to hear from us again, they never wanted to fill out another questionnaire or whatever, right? So we had them across all of these different domains of psychology, there was nothing that we found that matched up a working method to someone's psychological data. And so the protocol basically became a try it and see if this method worked type of protocol, put it into a very specific framework, a very specific cocktail, doing awareness related ones first wound up being better, doing body centred ones early wound up being better, there were just like these different things that we learned over time to create the right sequence, that allowed us to get to a much higher hit rate, you know, our initial hit rates were, like 73%, on average, in the early days of the protocol, which is more than enough to justify, then you've even got like 30, you know, whatever, 27% of people that you can use as a comparison group that didn't transition, right, which is super awesome if you're crunching data.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:12:55\n\nJust for listeners, what you're saying is that out of the early work you're doing, you're getting figures out of what at this point was like a three or four month course,\n\nJeffery Martin 1:13:07\n\nA four month course, took about three and a half hours a day at the time. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:13:10\n\nYeah a four month course, of three and a half hours a day, which is intensive, but I'm saying, you're getting to a point of about 70% plus of people who would transition to Fundamental Wellbeing who were not in Fundamental Wellbeing before. And that's extraordinary, that is extraordinary results.\n\nJeffery Martin 1:13:29\n\nYeah, it is. To us it's just so routine now that you know, at the time, it was like, this is incredible, you know, but now it's sort of like, it's normal.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:13:37\n\nI got that and there are many other things like how can more people do it, but what I just want to say on that point, and I think that's what we could delve into in a follow up, I hope, with this, Jeffrey, and I want to get a moment to thank you, but I want to leave you and listneners with the question, what's amazing for me is that we got to do this in this way, that this journey of empiricism can be useful, open minded empiricism can be really, really valuable. And I think there are a lot of other areas that, you know, kind of like how do we support a radically wiser weller society, radically wiser lives for ourselves, where this could be this could be useful. And I want to flag it, often there's been a scepticism in this kind of area of like thinking, no, no, you can't fit this into a box. We're not trying to fit it into a box, yeah, it's not fitable in a box, but there's still some things you can see about it. And I think that's a really big insight from this and that then it can turn into a useful protocol and beautiful application. So I just want to thank you for your time today and for explaining this. As a trailer for next time, I think we could talk a bit more about the map of Fundamental Wellbeing and particularly the protocol and how that has evolved and where you see it going and what you see the kind of frontiers are for this kind of work. Because I think the thing is, well, I now know there are more people, you and your community are still relatively small in this area and what would it be like if this was like, you know, all over the world, and we were doing much more, getting much more even more research data at the moment on these things. Totally. Enough to throw to AI even and stuff like that. Exactly. Yeah. So I just want to really thank you, Jeffery, for your participation. I hope we'll get to do a part two of these and have a really wonderful day and to our listeners, thank you for tuning in, there'll be another second or third episode out of this. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\n\n"},{"title":"Join the first Berlin Hub Residency!","image":"/assets/images/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-20-at-14.34.58-1.jpeg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"iljad20a2d59ebb","name":"Ilja Maiber","avatar":"/assets/images/Ilja-profile-2.jpeg","body":{"raw":"\nAs Hub manager Ilja makes sure the residents of the Berlin Hub have everything they need to be a living example of a wiser, weller world (and enjoy themselves while they're at it).

Beyond their own efforts they'll be inviting residents into stewarding roles to co-create a resilient, self-governing system.\n\n![](/assets/images/ilja.jpeg)\n\nIn his role as Hubmanager Ilja made sure that the structures of the hub support its inhabitants - gathering what felt like decades of learning in the process. Coming from studies in Rhetorics and Sociology he later dove into a transformative MSc in Strategic Sustainable Development (MSLS), which opened many doors: To hosting, narrative practices, co-creation, community building, participatory design and much in between and beyond. He dedicates himself in particular to the challenge of bringing together what is often separated: Be it the rational and the emotional, creation and reflection, planning and intuition, the physical and the mental.\n\n![](/assets/images/sen-2.jpeg)\n\nSen is lifelong community builder who loves fanning the sparks of creative expression in others. She is an occupational therapist by training, a storyteller by trade, and serial immigrant driven to support inner and outer healing through the transformative power of telling one's own story. As the founder of the Beyond Asian community, Sen's lived experiences as a Third Culture Asian immigrant inform her perspectives on social justice, diversity, and inclusion. She strives to bring embodiment to collective storytelling through mediums from podcasting to Theatre of the Oppressed.

Our understanding is that none of us is complete in our development, so we invite you to respond as honestly as you can about both your celebrations and challenges.\n\n**Can I come for a time period other than 3 or 6 months, or start my residency on a date other than Feb 1 or May 1?**\n\nHaving made the experience that every new person impacts the existing social fabric we strive towards clear entry points. If the idea of the residency really speaks to you, but these entry points just don't work for you - please indicate it in your application, or reach out via email (****theberlinhub@gmail.com****)! Together we'll see how we can go about the situation.\n\n**Can I leave the residency early?**\n\nEventhough we'd like you to stay the full duration of the residency (i.e. 3 or 6 months), we acknowledge that sometimes life is unpredictable. We invite you to indicate in your application if a full stay is not possible, so we can figure out together how to integrate this.\n\n**What are the arrival and departure dates and times?**\n\nWe suggest Feb 1, 2023 and May 1, 2023 as the arrival dates for each of the residenies, respectively, to give space\n\n**Will there be time for my personal work and projects?**\n\nIt is only during the Connection week that we ask everyone to make themselves available for the full schedule, barring major outside commitments (which we ask you to communicate as a part of your application). The remaining time of the residency will combine some daily shared practices with a largely open schedule to support personal work and projects. So there will be time for self-work and commitments like work and studies. A key aspect of the residency is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.\n\n**Do I have to attend all of the daily and weekly practices?**\n\nThe daily and weekly practices are considered essential aspects of co-creating a connected and regenerative culture. The general understanding is that everyone agrees to participate consistently in these practices, but if there is an occasional schedule conflict with an outside commitment, we simply ask that people communicate with us in advance. We ask that people reflect on their desire to commit to these shared practices before applying to attend. \n\n**What is the process for requesting financial assistance?**\n\nOur aim is that cost is not an obstacle to anyone’s participation. If you are experiencing financial constraints, please send us an email at ****theberlinhub@gmail.com**** describing: 1) your current financial situation; and 2) the specific amount of support you are requesting. We will do our best to see if we can provide assistance in some way or another.\n\n**What happens when I am on the waiting list?**\n\nIf all the places are booked, you are welcome to submit an application to be on the waiting list. We will review your application and invite you to an interview if/when a spot becomes available. Note that this could even happen at the last moment if someone cancels unexpectedly.\n\n**I don't think residency is for me right now** **or** ****my candidacy might not be selected**** - **but I would love to be a part of this project**! **How can I still take part?**\n\nFor those in Berlin, we offer an extended community Membership for those who want participate in practices, workshops, and events. Stay tuned for more!\n\n## Contact us\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us at **theberlinhub@gmail.com** if you have other questions that have not been addressed above, or in the resident application form. We look forward to receiving your application!\n\n### Acknowledgements and gratitude\n\nThis outline has in parts been inspired by the efforts of the facilitation and hosting team of the Life Itself Embodying Collective Transformation residency.

With all the amenities, such as Hasenheide park (a lush, tree-filled expanse of green), Tempelhofer Feld (an airfield converted to public playground), a beautiful cemetery behind the buiding, swans on the canal, weekly markets, public transport only 2 minutes away, and much much more around the corner, this is the ideal area for anybody excited to dive into a city bustling with energy, history, and heartfelt people.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nThe Hub consists of four apartments each with their own bathroom, kitchen, and flair. Complemented with a large common space and training dojo, it houses up to 11 residents. The apartments are spread out in a larger building complex, providing a unique set-up compared to many other communities.\n\n!\n\n\n\nWe aim to be a nourishing and inspiring home of friends and collaborators supporting each other in connecting to ourselves, each other, the wider world and what lies beyond (call it the mysterious, god or the sublime). \n\nFrom this connection, we grow our capacity to make tangible, impactful actions toward a regenerative culture in and beyond Berlin that works for all life. \n\nWe offer space, bring people together, and strive to live in a way that cultivates care, joy, stays with the trouble, and seeks wisdom continuously as we grow collective action out of connection to what’s in and around us. \n\n!\n\nUnfuck the system please - and move it towards regeneration!\n\n\n\n\nThe residency is hosted by Ilja Maiber and Sen Zhan, who've been living at the Berlin Hub for the last 2 1/2 years. Beyond their own efforts they'll be inviting residents into stewarding roles to co-create a resilient, self-governing system.\n\n!\n\nIn his role as Hubmanager Ilja made sure that the structures of the hub support its inhabitants - gathering what felt like decades of learning in the process. Coming from studies in Rhetorics and Sociology he later dove into a transformative MSc in Strategic Sustainable Development (MSLS), which opened many doors: To hosting, narrative practices, co-creation, community building, participatory design and much in between and beyond. He dedicates himself in particular to the challenge of bringing together what is often separated: Be it the rational and the emotional, creation and reflection, planning and intuition, the physical and the mental.\n\n!\n\nSen is lifelong community builder who loves fanning the sparks of creative expression in others. She is an occupational therapist by training, a storyteller by trade, and serial immigrant driven to support inner and outer healing through the transformative power of telling one's own story. As the founder of the Beyond Asian community, Sen's lived experiences as a Third Culture Asian immigrant inform her perspectives on social justice, diversity, and inclusion. She strives to bring embodiment to collective storytelling through mediums from podcasting to Theatre of the Oppressed. More on Sen's work at www.beyondasian.com\n\n\nThe full residency lasts 6 months, with a shorter 3 month option. Applications for 6 months are preferable.\n\n\nFull residency: Feb 1 - July 31, 2023\n\nSuggested arrival date: Feb 1, 2023\n\nConnection week: Feb 2 - 8, 2023\n\n3 month residency (Spring)\n\nSuggested arrival date: Feb 1, 2023 \n\nConnection week: Feb 2 - 8, 2023\n\n3 month residency (Summer)\n\nSuggested arrival date: May 1, 2023\n\nConnection week: May 2 - 8, 2023\n\n\nAt the beginning of each 3 month period we provide residents with the opportunity to participate in and take ownership of the structures which will help to orient in the space, develop a shared vocabulary and most importantly: spend quality time developing foundations of relationships of trust and courage with each other.\n\nPlease expect to make yourself available for this week, as the schedule will stretch over the course of the day from morning practice to evening check out (approx. 8AM - 9PM, with plenty of breaks in between).\n\nThe full schedule will be developed over the coming days. You can expect a flow like:\n\n\n9 - 10AM: Breakfast (self organized)\n\n\n1 - 2.30PM: Lunch\n\n3 - 5PM: Afternoon Session\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nConnection happens in many ways\n\n\nCommunity-lovers with a passion for and experience in co-creating nourishing living conditions for themselves and others, who have the desire and capacity to work on a project towards a regenerative culture.\n\nDisclaimer: While we strive towards acting in a trauma informed manner, and put the utmost care into cultivating a nourishing container, we are not certified therapists or mental health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential individual practices:\n\n    - Sitting or movement meditation\n    - Journaling\n    - Yoga\n    - Other practices supporting mind-body wellness\n\nEssential communal practices: \n\n\n\nEvery resident and steward is invited to manifest an aspect of their vision of a regenerative culture in the form of a project. You’re invited to bring something that others can experience, and that you would be proud to share. Together we can support how this project can be made available to the wider world, e.g. as part of an exhibition, on the Life Itself blog, in a workshop, or in other much smaller, or much larger ways\n\n\n    - Community practice or dinner\n    - Contribution to a circle (domains of governance such as Culture, Communication, etc - specifics to be determined during Connection Week)\n    - Engaging in active care for the common space\n    - Supporting or hosting an event/workshop/etc.\n    - Cooking or shopping for the community\n    - You'll find more information on what it means to step into a stewaring role in the application form\n\n\n\n\n    - Pictures of the rooms & apartments\n\n!\n\nBeautiful food from many cultures has been one of the beautiful parts at the hub\n\n\n\n\n\n    - If all places for the residency have already been filled, we'll put you on our waiting list and reach out if a place becomes available :)\n    - Optionally there’ll be an invitation into an additional creative modality to get to know each other, such as e.g. write a story, draw a picture, cook a meal together, or attending an open community practice\n    - Within first month of provisional residency, participate in a Group Feedback Circle with at least two current residents\n    - Contingent on consent of the hosting team, become a full resident\n    - Full residents participate in Group Feedback Circle every three months to renew full residency, contingent on ongoing commitment and embodiment of residency purpose\n\nWe are excited to receive your application and speak to you soon!

In addition, we will be hosting an open Q&A call in January - so stay stuned for more!\n\nWith much love,\n\nthe Berlin Hub\n\n\nWhat are you looking for in the application?\n\nIn this application we are most interested in how we can acknowledge and reflect both on how we all shine, and how we all struggle.

If the idea of the residency really speaks to you, but these entry points just don't work for you - please indicate it in your application, or reach out via email (theberlinhub@gmail.com)! Together we'll see how we can go about the situation.\n\nCan I leave the residency early?\n\nEventhough we'd like you to stay the full duration of the residency (i.e. 3 or 6 months), we acknowledge that sometimes life is unpredictable. We invite you to indicate in your application if a full stay is not possible, so we can figure out together how to integrate this.\n\nWhat are the arrival and departure dates and times?\n\nWe suggest Feb 1, 2023 and May 1, 2023 as the arrival dates for each of the residenies, respectively, to give space\n\nWill there be time for my personal work and projects?\n\nIt is only during the Connection week that we ask everyone to make themselves available for the full schedule, barring major outside commitments (which we ask you to communicate as a part of your application). The remaining time of the residency will combine some daily shared practices with a largely open schedule to support personal work and projects. So there will be time for self-work and commitments like work and studies. A key aspect of the residency is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.\n\nDo I have to attend all of the daily and weekly practices?\n\nThe daily and weekly practices are considered essential aspects of co-creating a connected and regenerative culture. The general understanding is that everyone agrees to participate consistently in these practices, but if there is an occasional schedule conflict with an outside commitment, we simply ask that people communicate with us in advance. We ask that people reflect on their desire to commit to these shared practices before applying to attend. \n\nWhat is the process for requesting financial assistance?\n\nOur aim is that cost is not an obstacle to anyone’s participation. If you are experiencing financial constraints, please send us an email at theberlinhub@gmail.com describing: 1) your current financial situation; and 2) the specific amount of support you are requesting. We will do our best to see if we can provide assistance in some way or another.\n\nWhat happens when I am on the waiting list?\n\nIf all the places are booked, you are welcome to submit an application to be on the waiting list. We will review your application and invite you to an interview if/when a spot becomes available. Note that this could even happen at the last moment if someone cancels unexpectedly.\n\nI don't think residency is for me right now or my candidacy might not be selected - but I would love to be a part of this project! How can I still take part?\n\nFor those in Berlin, we offer an extended community Membership for those who want participate in practices, workshops, and events. Stay tuned for more!\n\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us at theberlinhub@gmail.com if you have other questions that have not been addressed above, or in the resident application form. We look forward to receiving your application!\n\n\nThis outline has in parts been inspired by the efforts of the facilitation and hosting team of the Life Itself Embodying Collective Transformation residency. We appreciate the work your team is doing in the world and feel proud to have been collaborators in many ways.\n"},{"title":"Embodying Collective Transformation: reflections and highlights","image":"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-36.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"eilidhross","name":"Eilidh Ross","avatar":"/assets/images/IMG_6159-scaled-e1653305020765.jpg","body":{"raw":"\nEilidh studied Law at the University of Oxford before moving back home to Scotland to gain an MSc in Media, Communications and International Journalism from the University of Glasgow.

We welcomed over 35 participants, ranging in age from 19 to over 60, from over 10 different countries across 4 different continents. \n\n#### Looking back over the three months, we’re proud of and grateful for:\n\n- The incredible personal and collective learning and growth.\n- The deep sense of belonging, settledness in community, positive transformation, meaning, and purpose that we heard was experienced by many participants.\n- Increasing exploration of shared leadership month by month.\n- Successful navigation of multiple tensions while holding everyone with compassion.\n- The richness and diversity of offerings in our [Open Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) schedule. \n\n#### Our question for exploration was: “How are we called to deepen our individual and collective capacity to care for the wellbeing of all life?”\n\nIn practice, this looked like a smorgasbord of activities, incorporating the mundane, profound, simple, complex, heartwarming, vulnerable, playful, serious, easy, challenging, joyful, inspiring, experienced, experimental… A small sampling of those includes:\n\n- Offering, asking for, and receiving emotional support (e.g. empathic listening, IFS parts healing)\n- Cooking nourishing community meals together with fresh, organic ingredients from the local market\n- Practising giving and receiving (sometimes challenging) feedback\n- Caring for our collective space through cleaning, gardening, and tidying\n- Deepening personal self-awareness and awareness of interpersonal and relational dynamics\n- Making collaborative decisions around live issues in the community (e.g. what is our COVID policy?)\n- Learning about each other’s projects for work in the world and exploring synergies and potential collaborations, or starting projects together\n- Many meaningful connections\n- Slowing down… (e.g. inviting pauses of mindfulness)\n- …speeding up! (e.g. high-intensity interval training workouts together!)\n- Seeing, listening to, and holding others with compassion – and letting ourselves, too, be heard, held, and seen.\n\n#### In the words of one participant, what we did together was to “learn the art of loving”.\n\nIn her blog post, [‘Learning to Love ~ Transforming the World from the Inside Out’](https://ont-moeten.be/en/2022/11/24/learning-to-love/), Leni Cellini wrote:\n\n\"It has been one of the most healing and enriching experiences of my life.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nDuring the residency, I have discovered a path that leads to real inner and outer transformation. By getting to know others more deeply, I can understand myself better. And the more I accept the different parts in myself, the more I feel compassion and love for others. It is a path that requires patience, courage, and a lot of practice, but it also offers a specific way to grow into the direction of non-violence and love together.\"\n\nWe are grateful to everyone who contributed resources – time, money, energy, experience –  to make these residencies happen, especially to those who made donations to help make participation more accessible to those in need of financial support. We are grateful, finally, to each and every participant for our courage, companionship, and curiosity in coming together in the shared, and ongoing, exploration of what it means to thrive, evolve, and serve to make a world that works for all life.

We’re incredibly proud of what Life Itself Labs has accomplished in 2022. Here are some highlights:\n\n## We’ve established ourselves as a leader in the economic incentives of data sharing, and are making impactful contributions to EU policy in this area\n\nThroughout the year we’ve worked to engage key stakeholders across the private and public sectors, including the European Commission, around the vital role of incentives to support environmental data sharing. Our work has fed into major discussions around approaches to environmental data sharing across the EU and beyond, and will have a tangible impact on how the EU Green Deal strategy unfolds.\n\n  \nWhat’s more, our reputation as thought leaders in this space has seen us receive further requests for high impact involvement in 2023, so watch this space!\n\n## **We’re proud to be contributing to the growth of an exciting new social change ecosystem, and have secured funding to take expand our efforts**\n\n2022 saw us further expand and upgrade our [Ecosystem Mapping Project](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/) with new visualizations, an expanded database and a new, wiki-like infrastructure to open the map up for community contribution. You can read more about these improvements in our recent [blog](https://lifeitself.org/2022/10/25/ecosystem-mapping-update/).\n\nEven more excitingly, we’ve just secured EU funding to take our mapping efforts even further. We’re part of an amazing consortium of partners who will be exploring how this new social change ecosystem is manifesting in Europe, and how its insights and approaches might support key decision makers across the continent. \n\nWe’re aware that lots of our focus thus far has been on Europe, and have been proactively engaging behind the scenes with actors focused on responses to the global polycrisis elsewhere in the world. We’ll have some news to share around this in the new year, but are thrilled to be able to help connect the dots between pieces of this emerging movement all across the globe.\n\n## **We’ve become a recognised voice of reason in the volatile world of Web3, and have powerfully contributed to sensemaking in this area**\n\n2022 has been a wild year for the Web3 ecosystem as a whole, punctuated by huge crashes such as [Terra](https://web3.lifeitself.org/notes/financial-perpetual-motion-machine#2-terrausd-a-case-study-in-the-impossibility-of-financial-perpetual-motion) and more recently [FTX](https://web3.lifeitself.org/notes/post-ftx-collapse). For quite some time, Life Itself Labs has been advocating caution around the web3 ecosystem, drawing on our mix of social scientific and technical expertise to make meaningful contributions to the discourse and query some of the claims being made.\n\nSince March, to date, we've had over 12,000 users of our [Making Sense of Crypto & Web3 site](https://web3.lifeitself.org/), our [web3 podcast series](https://anchor.fm/life-itself) has had 3560 plays, and our [web3 YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg0Untv2MuxXRtnWGulmimhH5754YPVZt) has had 11,146 plays.\n\nOur expertise in this area has begun to be recognised and called on externally. We’ve delivered a final [report to the US Government Finance Officers’ Association](https://labs.lifeitself.org/projects/web3-local-government) offering guidance for municipal finance officials on engaging with Web3. We’re excited to share the published report early in 2023.\n\n#### We have (just) launched one of the most comprehensive sensemaking guides to the web3 and crypto space available\n\nWe’re incredibly excited to share an exciting new announcement: we’re launching our newly revamped guide to Web3 and Crypto! As this is the culmination of all our research and sensemaking work over the last year, we’ll share a full bulletin in the new year offering a full breakdown. But for now, here's a brief introduction...\n\nAfter nearly a year-long journey making sense of the world of web3 and crypto, the unclarity and uncertainty of the space doesn’t seem to be going anywhere fast. As we write this, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, has just been [arrested](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bahamas.html). At the same time, the value of bitcoin has once again miraculously [begun to climb](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today), and many of the more social change orientated web3 actors see the collapse of their more capitalist cousins as nothing but a positive. Throughout the turmoil, the narrative power of crypto manages to persist. \n\nIn other words, the need for proper sensemaking around this topic continues to be vital, even as the economic bubble seems to be popping. Particularly for those of us interested in transforming society, ensuring we’re directing our hope and resources in the right direction remains a vital goal. \n\nOur guide provides the most comprehensive analyses we are aware of of the largest claims made about web3 and crypto, and particularly their potential for social change. We’re proud that all our analyses are fully referenced to an academic standard, and even the less extensive content contains an extensive bibliography of sources all of which we’ve made accessible to read via an open Zotero library. What’s more, the entire site is wiki-fied to enable the expertise of our readers to develop it even further.\n\nIf you’re interested in deepening your understanding of some of the key issues and debates in the sector, then we wholeheartedly recommend you take a look.

We’re incredibly proud of what Life Itself Labs has accomplished in 2022. Here are some highlights:\n\n\nThroughout the year we’ve worked to engage key stakeholders across the private and public sectors, including the European Commission, around the vital role of incentives to support environmental data sharing. Our work has fed into major discussions around approaches to environmental data sharing across the EU and beyond, and will have a tangible impact on how the EU Green Deal strategy unfolds.\n\n  \nWhat’s more, our reputation as thought leaders in this space has seen us receive further requests for high impact involvement in 2023, so watch this space!\n\n\n2022 saw us further expand and upgrade our Ecosystem Mapping Project with new visualizations, an expanded database and a new, wiki-like infrastructure to open the map up for community contribution. You can read more about these improvements in our recent blog.\n\nEven more excitingly, we’ve just secured EU funding to take our mapping efforts even further. We’re part of an amazing consortium of partners who will be exploring how this new social change ecosystem is manifesting in Europe, and how its insights and approaches might support key decision makers across the continent. \n\nWe’re aware that lots of our focus thus far has been on Europe, and have been proactively engaging behind the scenes with actors focused on responses to the global polycrisis elsewhere in the world. We’ll have some news to share around this in the new year, but are thrilled to be able to help connect the dots between pieces of this emerging movement all across the globe.\n\n\n2022 has been a wild year for the Web3 ecosystem as a whole, punctuated by huge crashes such as Terra and more recently FTX. For quite some time, Life Itself Labs has been advocating caution around the web3 ecosystem, drawing on our mix of social scientific and technical expertise to make meaningful contributions to the discourse and query some of the claims being made.\n\nSince March, to date, we've had over 12,000 users of our Making Sense of Crypto & Web3 site, our web3 podcast series has had 3560 plays, and our web3 YouTube series has had 11,146 plays.\n\nOur expertise in this area has begun to be recognised and called on externally. We’ve delivered a final report to the US Government Finance Officers’ Association offering guidance for municipal finance officials on engaging with Web3. We’re excited to share the published report early in 2023.\n\n\nWe’re incredibly excited to share an exciting new announcement: we’re launching our newly revamped guide to Web3 and Crypto! As this is the culmination of all our research and sensemaking work over the last year, we’ll share a full bulletin in the new year offering a full breakdown. But for now, here's a brief introduction...\n\nAfter nearly a year-long journey making sense of the world of web3 and crypto, the unclarity and uncertainty of the space doesn’t seem to be going anywhere fast. As we write this, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, has just been arrested. At the same time, the value of bitcoin has once again miraculously begun to climb, and many of the more social change orientated web3 actors see the collapse of their more capitalist cousins as nothing but a positive. Throughout the turmoil, the narrative power of crypto manages to persist. \n\nIn other words, the need for proper sensemaking around this topic continues to be vital, even as the economic bubble seems to be popping. Particularly for those of us interested in transforming society, ensuring we’re directing our hope and resources in the right direction remains a vital goal. \n\nOur guide provides the most comprehensive analyses we are aware of of the largest claims made about web3 and crypto, and particularly their potential for social change. We’re proud that all our analyses are fully referenced to an academic standard, and even the less extensive content contains an extensive bibliography of sources all of which we’ve made accessible to read via an open Zotero library. What’s more, the entire site is wiki-fied to enable the expertise of our readers to develop it even further.\n\nIf you’re interested in deepening your understanding of some of the key issues and debates in the sector, then we wholeheartedly recommend you take a look. We’d love to know what you think!\n\nExplore our guide to crypto & web3\n\n  *\n\n\nhttps://lifeitself.org/2022/06/09/launch-announcement-life-itself-labs/\n"},{"title":"Thomas Steininger on Emergent Dialogue and Transcending Individualism","image":"/assets/images/Youtube-Thumbnail-Template-9.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"eilidhross","name":"Eilidh Ross","avatar":"/assets/images/IMG_6159-scaled-e1653305020765.jpg","body":{"raw":"\nEilidh studied Law at the University of Oxford before moving back home to Scotland to gain an MSc in Media, Communications and International Journalism from the University of Glasgow.

I'm really happy today to be joined by Dr. Thomas Steininger. He has been cultivating transformative \"We Space\" practices for nearly 30 years. He is a philosopher, a practitioner, and a spiritual mentor and has dived deeply into the practice of meditation and into the exploration of the evolution of human consciousness, particularly the current transition from a hyperindividual \"I\" culture, to a co-conscious \"we\" culture. As an authority on cultural evolution and the different spiritual and religious currents that have formed our postmodern world, he brings this perspective into his work as publisher of Evolve magazine, the leading German magazine on consciousness and culture and as a faculty at Meridian University in California. He also co-founded and developed a process of emergent dialogue, and advanced practice in conscious communication. So really, really welcome, Thomas, to the show. I would like to start by just asking you a little bit about how you started this incredible journey over the last 30 plus years in this area? What was your original encounter? Was it during your studies, was it later? I'd love to hear a bit about your background and how this started.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 01:46\n\nThank you Rufus, glad to be here. I'm very excited about this conversation. Yeah, it always depends where one wants to set the starting point. But if you really go way back to when I was studying philosophy at the University of Vienna, I was, at that time, very much a social activist. I was in the student parliament, the anti-nuclear movement was strong - I was in part of all of that - and I was very much interested in social change at that time, from a left-wing perspective. And I felt in all this kind of social activism that we did at the time that something was really going wrong. And, from what I would say afterwards, there was a lot of ego involvement in the way we went about with our ideas of how to change the world. So I kind of changed course in that and did a lot of psychotherapy, group therapy, did a lot of what was in the 80s kind of things to do in body-oriented therapy, encounter, Gestalt therapy, breathwork, and all this kind of stuff. And I realized that there was a perspective opening up in myself that was different than my social activist identity. And I, being a philosopher, I tried to read about it, and there was a lot of spiritual literature. And to be honest, I hated the spiritual literature because it was often beautiful but I felt that people don't really think. I had the arrogance, at least, of a philosopher that the people didn't really think. And then in the 80s, I found something, or someone, that really was for me an important life change experience. That was the early Ken Wilber. And the early Ken Wilber - in the 1980s, at least in Vienna, nobody knew Ken Wilber - was able to think about social historic realities from a deep consciousness perspective. And I, at the end of my studies, wanted to write my thesis about social change, the evolution of culture, from a deep consciousness perspective, and I wrote about this with a lot of what at that time the early Ken Wilber brought to the table, which was already evolution of consciousness and deep philosophical understanding of a deep dimension of reality that I drew from Martin Heidegger, his whole relationship between being and beings. And this kind of interest and in-depth understanding of who we are, the subject-object divide, led me into being involved in more spiritual work. And, in a spiritual community that I was involved in, mainly in the 90s, there was a work where we very much were looking into what does it mean to come together in a different way in a dialogical form. And this work was the starting work of our dialogue forms that we did. This community broke apart, there's a lot of things I could tell about that, but if you want to have a starting point, this kind of long story is kind of a starting point of how all this work started in my life.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 05:41\n\nWow. So a couple of things. So I'm always very interested, what was the context that had people in that very beginning inquiry? So just one short question first, about that fascinating odyssey, what was it that had you see in the activism work that there was something missing personally, for you? You know, was there any specific incident? Where did this feeling come from? Because I would guess that many other people you were involved with didn't go on that journey, through therapy or through this kind of spiritual inquiry. So I'm just intrigued, because that's even still very relevant to today, in many ways, that thing, although maybe the political situation and so on has evolved a lot. So for you personally, what was it?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 06:35\n\nIt's an interesting question. I could point to many things, but maybe, to pick one that was central for me, because our engagement at that time, our typical interest in the 1970s, 1980s, was very much anti-establishment power, against power structures, capitalism, old-fashioned power, but the way we acted between ourselves in all these student groups and university was very power-driven. There, the power dynamics were so much part of ourselves, that there was a huge contradiction between our understanding of having the longing for liberation and equality and people coming together, and the deep investment in just usual power struggles, equal investments and the power game, as you see it everywhere. And this conflict between our big ideals and the reality of how we lived between each other, and myself included by the way, was something that was bothering me. And there was a deep sense that something was missing. And on the other hand, that was part of what my dissertation was about, it was our understanding in this liberation movement about human alienation at that time, it was very much that alienation had to do with the production process with our capitalist societies, and all of that. And it felt for me that our being alienated from reality, from nature, from each other must go deeper than that; that's not the core of it. And in particular, more or less materialistic approach to this seems to be lacking a lot. And that's where the psychotherapy processes opened up for me and brought very deep experiences that also didn't fit to my kind of more down-to-earth naturalistic understanding of reality, so I had to deal with experiences with myself, and integrate them in my own understanding.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 08:50\n\nSo I just want to highlight that... maybe just as I think, for myself... to summarise it, one point was that in the very movements that were often yearning for liberation, for kind of solidarity, for a kind of form of participation without oppression, without domination... You know, I think what we mean by power structures, often, in that terminology, is kind of domination structures, you know, that's the power stance of that maybe. And this contradiction that you were seeing between the aspirations of the movement then the way that people were behaving, including yourself if you like, inside it. And the point that I think is most interesting is at the end, though, just there, you had this very insightful point, which is that while some people would have been, at that time, like, 'well, we're like this because, you know, we've been brought up inside a capitalist system and we've been sort of formed and we're just kind of reproducing these structures of oppression that have been imprinted on us. While there may be truth in that you also saw that some of this alienation from ourselves, from nature, from each other, went deeper, I would say ontologically, it was like an ontological aspect, more than just a structuralist aspect of it, that it went into our being or nature of our being, which, of course, is formed in society. I just want to flag that maybe we can come back to it or we can explore now, this question is really profoundly ongoingly relevant to all transformative projects, especially obviously, transformative political projects. And, you know, if we just talk that through for our audience, is that crudely I would say one story about the world is like, 'hey, we're going to transform things technologically, even our own being, we're going to invent pills, we're going to take a pill for that, you know, we're going to be a brave new world where you take this or you take out or you go to a movie that stimulates this or that, but we're going to, we're going to transform even our own being and our own well being almost technologically'. And another one, which is the traditional you might say Marxist or just generally, is like, 'okay, there's structures, we don't own the means of production, or, you know, we live in oppressive family structures that reincorporate the domination with the father over everyone else, or whatever. And if we break those structures, or transform those structures, if we create shared ownership of the means of production, or we reorder the nuclear family into a much better one, this alienation and this suffering in ourselves will kind of be transformed. And then finally, there's what I would call and we could discuss together, I don't know how you would call it, I'd be very interested, but an ontological emphasis, which is say, 'yes, those other aspects are, of course, relevant - technological and structural - but really, the fault, or the pathway, lies in ourselves. There's something deep in our human psychology that is transformable. There are practices, there are methods, but really there are deep things in humans that lead us to be alienated or to have suffering. And that remains, obviously, a really relevant question and distinction for ongoing projects of political or social transformation or personal transformation. I've kind of set that out, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Is that what you were alluding to? Or in your way, how would you put it? And how does that relate to what you see still today, or even then, in your evolution?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 12:47\n\nI mean, it has a lot to do with identity, with who do we identify being, in that sense. And even in this time that we are talking about now, in the 1980s, I had a very powerful experience that made a big difference that maybe speaks to that. In effect it was a spiritual seminar, it was called Enlightenment Intensive. And it's a very simple setting. It was a week and we were sitting in a couple of circles, and you were only doing one thing: you were with a partner, always changing, and one partner asks you one question ongoingly, \"who are you?\" And then you have five minutes to answer. And then it changes. So basically, the whole week, you just go with this one question, who are you? Who are you? And it really becomes interesting when you slowly run out of answers. When you have said everything who you are - a man, Austrian, da da da, activist, da da da - and you have said this already 10 times, something is loosening in your system and things become a little wobbly in that. And there is a point at least that happens for many and happened for me, where you lose deeply a sense of who you think you are. And something is opening up that is you, but you can't name it and it's meaningful. And of course, this is very much related to the meditation experience - big meditation seminars or the meditation tradition I think is very much also around this liberation from identity - and that was something that broke something open in me - not only that but that was part of the process - that still stays with me, where I think, if we use this big word liberation, there is something in our human soul where the capacity to develop an inner freedom from our identification allows us to be here with each other in a very different way. And if you call this 'spiritual justice' there, then this little opening in yourself, or maybe big opening in yourself, seems to be a very profound foundation for a different understanding of who we are as humans, and how we can be together as humans. And, of course, a lot of things changed since this Enlightenment Intensive workshop in Vienna, at the time, but it still speaks to what is important to me.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 16:01\n\nTo put it in simple words, that kind of liberation, from identity, has a sense of being available at any time or any place. Obviously, you may be different, different environments make it more available, even the very fact there is the Enlightenment Intensive, or do you have the leisure time to go and do it, or we could say various things, but the point is, from what we know of wisdom traditions that kind of liberation has been available in various forms in a whole variety of different cultures, political systems, for thousands of years, so it's kind of really distinct from liberation, maybe in the other more political, sometimes, senses one has. So to move on, so you read Ken Wilber, it had this really big impact, and then, I'd like to talk a little bit more, you said you joined this kind of community in the 90s and that there were certain things that broke down. I'd love to know a bit more about that, both its impact on you, but what were some of the things you learned, or what were the lessons, or what did you see out of that? And maybe you could say a bit more about that.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 17:20\n\nThe community that I joined, the name changed sometimes, but the name people still know is EnlightenNext. It was around the spiritual teacher Andrew Cohen. And one thing that I still appreciate, and what our work in the core was very much about, was that liberation, also spiritual liberation, it's more important what happens between us than just what happens in me. The work we were doing, and that's still very much related to the work that I'm doing now, was very much finding a way to talk with each other, where, using your word that you just brought it, where we are just available. Something, let's call it, the potential of the moment, is opening up because nobody puts him or herself in the way with identification - we don't have to call it ego identification, it's basically the same thing in my understanding - where one can be so there for this moment, that we can be so there for this moment, that this moment has a chance to show up between us with the potential that it does not have if everyone is clinging on to 'I have to be here', 'you have to be here' and 'my agenda has to come through', 'your agenda has to come through'. But all this doesn't have to completely disappear, one can be there, in fact we have to talk about how it's important also for the individual to be here, but for the individual to be here in a way that one is free from one's identification with one's separate individuality \\[and that\\] allows a different dimension to open up. And we did a lot of our work about it. One thing that was one of our major moments, it had a year-long grow log, but then some of us, something like 30 of us, at this time we were living at the East Coast, Massachusetts in  the countryside, we were for a period of more than three months, only meditating, nothing but meditating, and coming in this kind of dialogues. So we did nothing, but, I don't know how many hours, eight hours, ten hours meditation per day, for months, and every day we would come together in this kind of what we at that time called enlightened communication, and the goal was to be there without being locked into your ego, let's put it that way. And however you want to see that or analyse that, there are many things one can say about that, there was in particular one moment which was just very powerful, something was really breaking open that still is important to me, although a lot of things broke apart since then and we were not ego-free, liberated people all after that, but there was something liberating that was very meaningful and showed the different possibility of humans being together that was part of this work in this EnlightenNext community. That was also one of the pillars of my life that really still is there and important for me.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 21:23\n\nWow. And, I mean, it's so difficult to talk about these kinds of things powerfully and without... not being it. But just to ask you, so when you say something was breaking open, or there was this experience, so first of all, maybe even to backtrack, how do we normally dialogue or speak? You know, maybe if we're contrasting, maybe we all have experience, but maybe you could just give a concrete vivid illustration of what does it normally look like, and maybe it can be from one's own life, but what's this in contrast with? What's the kind of dialogue or the way that we encounter each other normally? \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 22:28\n\nWhat I would highlight here is that usually when we normally dialogue, that's already a high achievement to dialogue and not to debate, to just make the distinction.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 22:42\n\nOkay, so tell me what's debating?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 22:47\n\nThe distinction between debating and dialoguing, one could say, debating is very much where I want to convince you of my way of seeing reality, and you want to do the same from the other way and then either one wins, or we find a compromise, or we find some synergy, but it's basically a battle of perspectives. Debating is a form of battle of perspectives and either with power or with convincing arguments, I can convince you or I can silence you, and then someone wins the debate. Debate is something that someone is winning; a dialogue is not something someone is winning.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 23:25\n\nLet's pick a toy example that we could think of that would be relevant today that people might debate about, talking about it right now gives a kind of chewiness to it for people listening. It could be about, I don't know, the war in the Ukraine, or it could be about something vivid, like, I don't know, Donald Trump or, you know, President Biden, or something. Can you just give me one example where you and I were debating right now about something?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 23:57\n\nIt could be the war in Ukraine, it could be, as we were talking about, the sense and nonsense of Web3. It could be also who is washing the dishes today?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 24:18\n\nYeah. So let's pick Ukraine, maybe, just for example, what would the debate look like? Like what would one of us say like, or maybe I don't know, on the Web3 one, it might be even like, 'okay, Web3 is amazing', or 'Web3 is useless', but what would it look like?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 24:38\n\nThe main ingredients that makes a debate a debate is that I know what is true and I want to find ways to put this truth on you, either that you agree, or at least that you are not able to counter my argument, that I'm able to silence you. So the way when I talk about the war in Ukraine, I know what it is and I hear you disagree, and I hear your arguments, and then I'm looking for the weak spots of your argument so that I can make clear why you're wrong, and why I'm right. But the foundation is that I'm very based in my conviction of knowing and that the whole orientation of the debate is to expand my knowing to other people, so that they become part of my knowing in that. And of course, it can get more complicated, you also can convince me, but basically, underneath is this foundation of identity and knowing that is fixed and that tries to win. And that, I would say, is the basic characteristics of what the debate is about. Which also can be powerful. It's like a powerful chess game.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 26:17\n\nSo let's take an example that maybe, even at least for our average listeners, so imagine I'm quite convinced that Russia is wrong, Vladimir Putin is wrong, they shouldn't be invading Ukraine. If I were coming from, like, 'I know that', this is not meaning I can't have a conviction in a view, but it's like, 'I know I'm right'. Or it could be vice versa, I'm like, 'I think Putin is great and I think Russia have got right on their side', that would become a debate with this clash of opinion about it. And what would then a dialogue start to look like? And then we're going come to a kind of emerging dialogue, or, I don't know, enlightened dialogue. What even would dialogue look like between you and me? Let's say, I'm pro Russia at the moment, you're pro Ukraine. What would it look like?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 27:21\n\nIt's cool to ask this question. The main difference is, I would say, is that in debate I'm listening for something different than I would listen for in a dialogue. In a debate, because I'm convinced of whatever, I listen for where you object and where the weak points of your objections are. It's a whole usual thought process of warfare, I look for your weak spots so that I can come through with my arguments. When I listen to what you're saying, basically, I'm looking so 'ah, he's saying that and that, and that's a weak argument. I go in there.'\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 28:10\n\nYeah. Yeah. So let's say in here, it's like, you say something about Ukraine, and I'd be looking just like, 'well, that's wrong, because of this, you know, look the US are supplying, and you'd be like, 'no, look, at the Russians', right. And in a dialogue, what are we looking for? What are we listening for then?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 28:32\n\nThe main thing, I would say, or the starting point is that I really try to understand you, even if you're thinking the opposite, that you're thinking that really Putin is right and it's all about NATO east expansion, and Russia is cornered and they have to defend their security interests and basically it was the NATO who started this war already in the 1990s when they promised to... you can make all the arguments. In dialogue you listen differently when you try to understand the other, even if you disagree, to understand where does he or she come from? What's this world about? And in the difference that is occurring, there is still place for argument where I think 'da da da doesn't make sense', I bring it, but the foundation is listening for mutual understanding. Now, here you are as the other with this other perspective which I really don't understand and maybe really annoys me, or triggers me in whatever way, but I'm curious enough to try to create something where there's mutual understanding, some bridge-building possible between one and the other, not kind of in the flatlining, I don't care, still holding my ground. Not kind of just being 'I don't care'; I care not only about you, I also care about myself and holding this tension, this friction, that can be very uncomfortable, because it's a place where I really don't agree with you, but to still want to listen with you.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 30:57\n\nYes.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 31:00\n\nAnd then there is something, I make a little leap here, but I think it's interesting because we've worked with this very example quite often and it illustrates something: when I listen to you, how vulnerable can I be in this listening? A good thought experiment is, if you say something that really would pull the carpet from underneath my feet, would be very disturbing, not that I have to agree with you, but if that is the case, do I really want to hear you? Or do I make a choice that there's some things I don't want to hear, because I don't want to be shaken up where I stand. And I'm not even saying that it is important to let the rug be pulled, I'm not saying that, but just as a thought experiment to see there's a point where I'm not sure, at least that's the way I always go to this, I'm not sure I really want to hear you because holding my ground is essentially more important than hearing you and to be aware that this is the point where I stopped talking with you. Just to be aware that it takes a lot of courage to make this spot more open that even if what you have to say to me is really maybe destroying my whole world just because something is coming in that I have not thought about or whatever, do I have the courage to hear your or do I basically shut down because I want to be not irritated in my security of my self identity. And you see this is quite often the end of a conversation, although we can continue talking, but basically, there is a wall and I close my ear when you bring this up and find a way around it and 'this is waterproof' kind of thing, because I don't want to be touched. And just to be aware of this shows how dialogue can really be something open, how dialogue can be really dangerous, how it also needs an atmosphere of trust, because to do this with someone who is not trustworthy is maybe a stupid thing to do.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 33:37\n\nYeah.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 33:38\n\nBut if there's a trustworthy relationship, a lot that is transformative, profoundly transformative, can happen in any conversation. And \\[especially\\] when there's so much trust that basically I don't stop listening.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 33:58\n\nCan I ask then, to make it concrete, if you could share even, let's say, in the EnlightenNext community, and in these moments where you were really doing this profoundly, what kind of things would you dialogue about? Can you give a concrete example from your own past experience that really opened something up for you that you were dialoguing about? And it might have been a very simple topic, but that kind of makes it concrete for me or the listeners, something that could really be that powerful. I mean, I can imagine but I would just like to hear.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 34:33\n\nI mean, what comes to my mind, and that was part of the spiritual work, we talked a lot about our ego-structures, my male arrogance, or, for example, about my German identification, German identity, in relationship to a lot of denial of what happened in the Second World War and a lot of justification, and a lot of 'da da da' where I just feel very comfortable because being Austrian slash German - to make this not differentiated for the sake of the conversation - a lot of things that in my environment are just a shared given, how Austrians see themselves as they were victims of history and not perpetrators in that sense, and how we translate it in the generation after the war, and how we find justification stories, and to see, in that sense, our cultural identity being built around certain myths and certain blind spots, that if somebody else shares that you very easily touch a pain point where you're not sure you want to go there. And that same thing's true for any history, any identity, talking about American identity and American race history, Native Americans' extinction, whatever. And it doesn't have to be histories, it's also my personal relationship with maybe you or maybe my partner there, my male superiority is just playing out in a way and because I may be able to play some intellectual game, I can hold power in this way and I don't want to let go, and I don't want to see it, and people just saying, 'hey, look', and maybe you don't want to look, because you don't want to see yourself because it shatters a little bit your ideal self-perception; things show up that you don't want, shadow work.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 35:44\n\nSo in the eight or ten hours you would do this meditation, what then? Would there be a group dialogue? Or would it be you dialogue with someone else, and they would bring up these things potentially?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 37:42\n\nThis kind of dialogues that I was just describing we did over many years ongoingly together. And there are also danger points with that because you can create group dynamics and group perspectives, cultish forms of dialogue structures of that, which was also part of what happened with us. So there are also shadow points and blind spots in this. But in, in this particular face that you're pointing to, around this, it was more about the capacity to allow something between us to emerge that is shared and something that we are together in, but standing also on our autonomy, it's not kind of a group thing, but it has its own wholeness where a dialogical field can be also rooted in something very deep, which is kind of connected to what I just shared before about this Enlightment Intensive experience, where it's not about me, Thomas, but something, the life itself, shows up between us like that, and to have conversations where we find a way to this relational fields to be self-aware, let's put it that way.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 39:40\n\nAnd what kind of topics were you talking about in the group? Can it be anything? Were there particular things?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 39:55\n\nI have a hard time to remember exactly what we were talking about at that time. On one hand it was very personal, on the other hand, it was very atmospheric. But that was also very specific about this particular work that we did at that point so I wouldn't make this too general a point because that was related to that particular work we tried to do at this time in this context. And in the end, it is not important. Yes. In the end, what I think is important is what you have pointed out to be available for whatever, and what I mean by being available for whatever is what is relevant in this situation that I'm here right now. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 40:49\n\nI suppose why I'm also speaking to it is it can sound to some people a little bit, I would say, almost magical, like there's this wholeness or this field. So before I got this very concreteness of it, which I can see, which is there are things that you could say to me that like, 'can I be with them?' You know, that I can really see that, and that there's something in my ego, there is something that is opening up a spaciousness in myself, where maybe a disidentification with those things. I mean, I want to say for myself is the things we've done that aren't so nice, I always sometimes have said that, you know, I think the hardest thing is to have been, if I were a rapist, to really be able to be with that. Not to make it okay or anything like that, but we always have such self-image of how we were good, or, you know, the ideal of ourselves, and to be able to somehow hold that and not 'oh, it doesn't matter', but somehow stepping back from it creates this space around so many things, because we so identify with our positions, including our positions about who we are like, whatever they might be, you know, like, I'm smart, I'm good, or that I'm not good, or whatever those are and so I really see that. And then you were saying there's sort of this field that emerges, as you said, that it's something in the dialogue in the space which is more than the sum of its parts yet it isn't a dissolution that we sometimes have crudely, like, I'm going to dissolve into some kind of like, you know, group, it's somehow more than but yet respect to the individuation, but it's just, I'm only coming back to it \\[because\\], why I'm asking is for the concreteness of it is, I get that it's not important but it just makes it real, potentially, for people who may or may not have experienced such a phenomenon? \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 43:22\n\nI'm not sure if the concrete content makes it more real. And let me talk about the magic that you brought up. I would say it is magic. But what I mean with that is, or to explain myself, I think that individuation is also magic. One very down-t- earth understanding of magic is what we create with language. I find it magic when I use a word, like the word tree, and I'm pretty sure that in your consciousness somehow something like treeness shows up. That's the foundational form of magic, to be able to manifest something to language. And since we started to use language in human history, we also started magic. Magic and the start of language happened pretty much at the same time in that sense. And the fact that we were able as a species - to step back a little bit and take a meta perspective here which I think explains something - that we were able to basically leave our embeddedness in the natural process that we were in and shared with all other natural species, that we were able first to form identities as a tribe, this particular cultural forms, and it was all done with language into, starting with different forms of storytelling, coming in the hero story, all of a sudden there was the creation of the individual that stands out of the indigenous tribe, it has its own onus and the basic story form of the hero is the one who stands against the embeddedness, embeddedness with nature, embeddedness with the gods and goddesses and finds his onus. With Odysseus, or Ulysses, Homer did an amazing piece basically showing our Western, Greek, European individuation process. How Ulysses basically is able to fool the gods with the forces around him to basically enforce his own individuation, his own heroic existence, in that. That is a form of magic that he created and that created our whole culture, at least our European, Modernist culture, it's based on a certain perspective that we hold with this language, it's based on the separation that we kind of manifest, that I am myself and I'm related to objects and even other people I can objectify and can have instrumental relation \\[with\\], it's a whole world that we are creating through a cultural magical game, that even science in this form creates this magic, as a scientific language. That creates a certain awareness of reality that's based on subject-object relationship, subjectivity, instrumentality to create this world that we created as a species, as a culture. And maybe we are at a turning point right now where this game comes to its own end. There in the hyper individuation process, and the whole epidemics of narcissism, the shadow sides of this game are showing so strongly that there is an evolutionary drive to find new forms of free integration in wholeness. This experience that I was describing of a relational field, is maybe an attempt to not lose individuality, but to create an awareness that even individuality is embedded always in relationship, and to have a psychological, emotional, spiritual relationship to this embeddedness and then you give it the word field to express this. But of course, it's not a physical field or whatever, you use a word to express something that somehow has a relationship to a certain experience, that has some resonance with the experience. And that, I think, is something that is happening right now, in many places, not only in the spiritual community that we were in, but in many places, that it seems that our hyper individual, postmodern world is looking for forms of free integration. Thich Nhat Hanh's interbeing, reinterpreting Buddhism with this interbeing language, goes, from my interpretation, in the same direction in some way other people do similar work in that. So there seems to be something in the air, where the evolution of culture and consciousness is seeking, magically, to find new language games, to talk with Wittgenstein, that allows us to experience and communicate our embeddedness. And that's how I would interpret this experience. Sorry, it was a long answer, and a little philosophical one.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 45:53\n\nYes, let's talk about the magic.  It's great. So I want to come back to that, let's work that through for myself and maybe for listeners, and I think maybe also to expand on it in examples of what we mean by these terms like individuation and then integration. So I maybe want to bring another example that we're all familiar with, well which we all went through whether we remember it, but we might know if we've seen babies. So as a tiny child, when a child is born, from what we know and obviously, we can't really interview very young children, but we can do kind of experiments to understand how they see the world. They may not really see themselves as separate from the world, like they kind of are the world that they're in and a really tiny one-week- or a few-month-old baby is their sensations and doesn't have a sense of their body separate from the environment and things like that. And there's a sense, I'm picking an analogy, but you were also using it in the grand historical perspective, which I want to come back to, but there's a sense of individuation in a child as they start to see themselves as separate, like, there's some kind of distinction of them. And that's a very natural, and even healthy, phenomenon. And what you're also talking about, I'm just kind of trying to get that for people to understand individuation, there's a sense of, at one point the child is totally embedded in their environment, in a sense. Similarly, while again we can't go back in a time machine and go back 50,000 years or 100,000 years or even 10,000 years and really understand, or interview Homo Sapiens and understand how they see the world. There is a sense in a historical perspective, from the literature we have, from what we do know, and even from societies we know today, like indigenous, that there wasn't the sense of the individual distinct from who they were interwoven with the group. And what we're talking to here is that there's been, there's a suggestion, that there's been a big historical process, which is both a victory and, as we just discussed, has many shadows, of individuation, what that means, just like the child stops being just 'I am one with the environment', in an actually healthy way, they see 'ah I've got a boundary of my body', that there are objects in another sense. For example, very, very young children, if you do experiments, don't really, if an object disappears, for them, it's just gone out of existence, they don't search for it, it's gone, if I hide something behind the chair. And at some point the child realises there are objects out there, as it were, \"in the world\" that can disappear and that they can search for, they can recover, that are separate from them. I'm giving the very concrete examples from developmental literature. But this sense of individuation goes on. And, first of all, just if there's anything you want to say, to do better than me in kind of setting that up, and then there's a sense of which that has extended, that's become, we'll come to I think in a moment, this era we're in that has become so exaggerated or taken to such extremes, that the shadows of it have become very apparent, though we should acknowledge the great victory. But first, was there anything you want to say just to kind of spell out individuation. And I think this is really profound, again, it comes back to the ontological theme, but also really talks actually deeply, if people are listening, to think to how this relates to some of the predicaments, like concrete things like we talked about, like narcissism, but also what's going on with our political systems or our challenges of dealing with global crises like the ecological crisis, the climate crisis. I also want to end, I'm just flagging this for people, I want to come back to, one modern reaction, say, 'Oh, we want to go back'. We want to go back to the wisdom of indigenous cultures, which have huge amounts of wisdom, but in some of the story here is it's not one wants to go back, it's like the pendulum will swing, but it doesn't swing back, the pendulum is moving upwards, we're tracing, if you like, a helix upwards, so I want to come to all of those things. But I just want to start with the individuation point just to explain that for people, because it's a kind of a technical term and I know it relates to Jung and other things. What do we mean by individuation?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 54:02\n\nThank you for that. And this is a moment where I really regret that Elizabeth, my partner is not here because she is a developmental psychologist and really has a lot to say to that. But what you're describing, I think is also common knowledge. We know that and of course, people like Piaget really... that's what their work is about, to describe these changes that you are describing. And one thing that all of us know besides the examples that you just brought is when a child I think at the age of around three starts to change language and not talks anymore about oneself in the third person but the first person and just to see what it takes in consciousness to... or what it means to talk about yourself in the third person is kind of a loose way that the identification process reaches a different firmness when you don't talk about him, but I talk about me. And then this meanness really starts. And this is also, as far as I know, where the first really rebellious phase in life happens, where you really start to try the boundaries of your parents. Because you encounter the choice of saying no, basically, 'Oh, no, no, no' and screaming because you want something... all the willfulness... you you're starting to experiment and play with your own willfulness in a way where we discover something that is our essence. And I really think what you are pointing out that often because we are aware that narcissism is such a theme of our time, and our disconnectedness is such a theme that we all suffer from, and the whole wave of indigenous renaissance that we are living through right now, expresses also that we realise that those cultures who have not gone through the same process of modality that we have gone through hold some forms of wisdom that we have lost. But there is a very simple example again, that I think highlights what you were pointing to. Because when we were not separate, yet, in our indigenous tribe, there was a real power and united togetherness. Also, by the way, togetherness with nature \\[is included\\] in this, we have not objectified each other and all of that and and that's partly \\[what\\] our romantic sense is responding to: 'wow, this is beautiful, this is powerful'. And this is true. But there's another element that's worth looking at: that this was not a choice. This was a given. Nobody could step out of the tribe, there was no freedom to step out of the tribe. Literally... there are enough examples to demonstrate that people, indigenous, being taken out of the tribe die. And not because they starve or something like that, maybe that too. But psychologically, you just cannot take that you don't exist outside. So to see that this is powerful, but there's also a necessity built in and a lack of freedom to do anything else but that. That is a very different situation than we are in, that we can say no, I'm not part of the society. I'm not part of this culture. I'm not part of this family. And I really can do my thing. And it can be very narcissistic. But we also can make a choice to come together. But this togetherness is different, fundamentally different because it's based on our choosing capacity to do so. To to be aware that this kind of togetherness is based on the freedom to choose, that's very different than the factuality of just being together. It shows that this is not a going back to some romantic idea, but what I would call here trans-individuation, the rediscovery of our embeddedness in our togetherness, \\[which\\] is always based on our capacity of free choice, and also the responsibility to choose the right form of togetherness, because you can also choose the Nazi form of togetherness, and that's maybe something one can discuss if it's the right thing of coming together. So our form of responsibility of individuation and only with individuation as you will responsibility, for someone who is re-sponsible, forms a different way of this related, this field of relationship that's different than the indigenous one can learn a lot. But we also have to learn a lot from our process of individuation. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 59:34\n\nYes, I think that's really important exactly to acknowledge and I think this is, again, to actually come back always to the political point, if I can bring it up here, is the traumas of individuation, which may go back much further than certainly even in modern times, you know, that people think of, whether it's the Nazi rallies or it's the Inquisition... this incredible victory meme that dominates, for example, if you go just read political theory most of it's about how do people have freedom to kind of do what they want, you know, in the sense of play whatever music or read whatever books... this is just incredible victory. That shows up-- I'm giving formal examples in our kind of governmental... but the kind of underlying ontological achievement that represents is, what you're saying is kind of massive, and almost not acknowledged and particularly in these moments because it is now gone, its shadows have arrived. And so just to acknowledge that, the great victory of that freedom, and it shows up even in victory today, which is, you know, many, many societies are and were patriarchal, you know, the victories of individuation are still being reaped, whether I think they relate, you know, many of these areas, to see people, as sovereign individuals with their own rights, and all these kinds of things. And the trauma, though, that we are still dealing with of that victory, and, well not that vic-, but also, you know, of dealing with the group and oppressions by the group, and so on. And what you're now coming to is to say, but we also see the great limitations of what we could call hyper individuation, you mentioned narcissism, but an atomized society, you know, the things we can say are kind of classic: loneliness, but also, our great, our lack of embeddedness, or connection, with nature in a visceral sense. The other thing that I want to reiterate in all of this is that we have to necessarily on a call like this, we can't really do practice, although I and Thomas can be kind of, I hope, practising a bit the concreteness of this. The visceralness of these things, in both directions. And so when we say, 'Oh, we're not embedded in nature,' I mean, in a way, I could have no idea of what it really means, although I grew up in the country, \\[I could have no idea of\\] what it really means to be connected, fully connected with nature, in a certain way, but that this is something that really is showing up today in the way that we act, the way that we behave, the way that we are, the way we operate. And I wonder, therefore, coming to one of the things that you're really looking at is ways that we're not necessarily going back because we can't, we don't, we cannot go back. In a sense, it's not the same thing. What is the going forward? So then that does come back -- this is what you've been describing even earlier in these experiences in these practices. And again, this magic, you said, is we're looking for ways really to integrate the victories of individuation, of our autonomy, of our individuality... back, though, into something that is a collective but that isn't a reversal \\[...\\], it's something really where that autonomy and responsibility and sovereignty or something is preserved, yet there is something new that emerges and there is a sense of being the collective and connectedness and so on. Is that what the, that's what the work that you...?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:04:03\n\nAbsolutely. To emphasise what you're pointing to, that is also what Ken Wilber calls the dignity of modernity, that we right now tend to forget, because we are so much in the drama of modernity right now. So, rightfully, we also have to emphasise how we move beyond that and also beyond the postmodern revolt against that, to integrate it on a higher level, but it has to be honoured, the dignity. It has to be seen, has to be in there. Otherwise, we end up with all kinds of regressions. So, this is a critical point to make. And what this really means ongoingly has to be found out on a theoretical level but also on the practical level. And to talk more from a practical level, I think that's at least what our Emergent Dialogue practice is focusing on that is developed out of that what we did in the 90s. And what we did afterwards in our work here a little bit peopled by Partner and others. Here, we are working this now, since, I think, it goes to 30 years now. And one simple way to understand what an anchor point can be to enter this different form of being together here is what I would call synergetic intuition. It sounds a little bit like a mouthful and a fancy word and I'll try to explain what I mean. But when we are, in whatever situation with whatever factors, let's have people and beyond people, there is a multitude that comes together and builds a situation. Let's say we are in a dialogue, and there are 10 people. And let's leave all the other factors out right now. Let's just focus on these 10 people, different perspectives, different life stories, different agendas, different drama points, different hopes. And there's a conversation that has a certain reason why we are here. And there is a multitude, and how does this multitude find a wholeness? How do we not stay fragmented or fragment so that I have no clue... The worst thing is that we fight each other, but also just to be next to each other and have no real relationship is a form of fragmentation. That we as the circle of 10 people say \\[...\\] we just don't find the wholeness, a meaningful wholeness, that everyone knows when the conversation comes to its own and somehow it feels very meaningful, what we're talking about, and we're all in it, and something's happening. And it's beyond my agenda or your agenda. It's happening. There's some meaningful wholeness building, because we did something right, let's put it that way, or something right happened, however. And I think one word to understand this rightness is the beautiful word synergy. That 'synergy' means that different points, factors, identities, all look for how they can form a meaningful whole. And it makes a huge difference in any situation, when I'm interested, have a sense organ for this synergetic capacity of a situation, and I'm in support of it to show up or not. And when enough people in a room have a focus and the capacity to really \\[...\\] support this, synergy happens in a much more profound way, in a much more powerful way. And the potential between us gets multiplied just because we don't focus fragmentation. We focus on synergy and synergy does not mean that we fall into one. And there is no difference anymore. It is a creative relationship of difference, even greater friction, where I don't agree with you but there's something very powerful in this disagreement that's really interesting. We don't even have to agree in the end. But still, it was very enriching to have this conversation with you. If you agree or disagree, maybe both \\[are\\] a good outcome, but something synergized in this and the capacity to be there for this synergetic field is, I think, a way to understand what this form of being together holds in a way that I'm not primarily interested in me and my agenda and you and your agenda and debate or whatever. But we are together. We are here together for something that is a creative wholeness, that we still have to find out what it is.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:09:30\n\nAnd again, so if you, if I were thinking for myself, or listeners to think for themselves, it would be interesting to say let's just pick something simple. Your partner and you \\[for example\\], I don't know, there's some debate over what one's going to do this week, you know, whether we're going to go to the cinema or whether we're going to go to the theatre, or let's say something more profound, I'm just kind of wondering... so like for you, or even could you give an example of like when you've seen this happen, where you've seen a group having to decide on a topic, and it could be a present topic, or it could be something, a really big discussion about the Ukraine war, and what you've seen happen when it does go into this versus not -- just describe that? Yeah, I'm just trying to...\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:10:27\n\nLet me give a very concrete example out of my life that just happened a couple of weeks ago. And yeah, that I found significant. We do in our work, every summer, a retreat. And we did it in the last years in Italy, in Assisi. This year, we wanted to go out of some reasons to a powerful place in Turkey. And then the war happened. And it just did not feel right. To go to a retreat in Turkey, it kind of felt like some escapist thing... So a couple of us came together and just were expressing this, feeling uncomfortable with this. And out of this conversation came the idea, why don't we go to Berlin? Berlin is a city that holds so much. It's a symbol, the reality of division in our time, and also the creative response to division. So there's something very powerful in the place of that, and that just happened out of this conversation, then we had no idea how we were to do this. And we had some friends in Berlin, we started to talk. And to cut a long story short, we came up with some friends in a very powerful co-working, co-living space, and another friend who runs a community, in Berlin with young people, they call themself the Church of Interbeing... and they, we, we said, let's do this together. And then we had a process where we just are in many Zoom calls. And then in a couple of days in Berlin, we just went from our places and talked: how do we do this retreat together? And everybody has their places. And somehow it felt \\[as though\\] nobody really designed this retreat. It was a conversation, where things fell into place. It was even not only a conversation between people, we also we went to different places and felt that the place told us something, how to do this. And this listening to this ongoing synergetic presence between us, the places and the idea, allowed in a very short time that a retreat unfolded and in the end was, at least from my sense, very powerful and very successful. But it really happened in its own emergence and listening to the unknown between us: how does this potential want to arrive here? And it was not someone having an agenda, let's do this. And it was really ongoingly being very open and in the unknown, and seeing, 'Oh, wow, this fits together, well, this fits-- no, this doesn't fit together'. Now, all of a sudden, it's a synergetic whole building, that in the end, I am just very happy how it happened. So that's was for me really an expression of a synergetic coming together, where none of us there over-invested and also there was no ego involved. But we were not overly invested in our ego, so that something powerful \\[could\\] emerge between us that was beyond ourselves and \\[that\\] in the end, I think, was really in service of the situation, the people involved and everything else.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:14:09\n\nAnd also, do you have a converse example of something you've ever experienced? Where you didn't feel that dialogue? Or for some reason there was a block -- and what happened then? Like, have you ever done an event where that wasn't somehow in place and therefore things... you felt that discussion happen... I'm just trying to work out how people can feel that when they have it...\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:14:31\n\nYeah, I do... what comes to my mind right now is a group of people that I'm involved in since some years where we are also again from different backgrounds, or worked together, how to create a more conscious culture in Germany. And to cut it short, COVID ripped us apart. The investments in different forms \\[of\\] how to respond to COVID, to be with the establishment response or with the more alternative, even conspiracy, response are... although we are very conscious people, we were not able to hold it. We fragmented, and not to give any one of us now... we fragmented... we were not able to hold this difference in a creative, co-creative, synergetic way. I'm \\[...\\] still looking for what can happen in the future, but for the moment we failed.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:15:56\n\nSo, yeah, I mean, this is what I want to bring up, it's something that I think is really subtle, which, just for example, a friend was talking about recently. Which was put in a simple way, there was an event he was participating in. And he's also from a research background. You know, he was in academia, and the thing he really respected in academia was \\[...\\] particularly in research collaborations-- So his interest was when when you saw groups operating, like good research groups, because in academia, you can be in departments. And there's different reading groups, or different research groups, and some are really kind of not very functional, you know, and some are really productive. \\[...\\] And so that's just the context. And he was in a group and there was a lot of stuff about, like, everyone had to speak equally, and they were like asking a relatively expert question about like, how do you do research to assess, you know, something? And what he was noticing, which is something sometimes that happens today, and I'm asking this in this kind of question of dialogue, which is, you know, there was a kind of a bit of formality, like people felt like, everyone, you know, there's a question of who should speak, you know, who had power... there are these things that come up. But even that there are differences of opinion? I guess, yeah, this question, which is, when you operate with a lot -- I'm not articulating this question super well, so I'm gonna kind of work it through, and we're going to make it a bit what we can... What he was saying, what he saw in research groups was there was a tolerance for inequality of speaking or participation at given moments because someone had expertise. But the group had this core purpose, and that would dance, it wouldn't be someone who always-- In a given moment, it would be like, 'Okay, we got a statistics question. This person knows a lot about statistics.' But you could also have very strong differences of opinion, that would, at least in productive groups, there could be clashes, but it would somehow synergize and you would move on. I guess why I'm trying to bring this up is that what I'm hearing is that also, this isn't about being nice. This kind of practice of something emerging isn't about us all being like, oh, everyone's view is of equal validity. But there's somehow an ability to add, to kind of be with productive tension or creative tension. And in this group that kind of pulled apart-- like, I guess what it is is: what is it that allows the group to not have too much tension or be pulled apart versus...? You know, it sounds like when you did, \\[when\\] you're available, and everyone's kind of committed to the mission, \\[when\\] there's a general alignment, and even maybe cultural alignment, there are going to be differences, but there's enough kind of shared... It's like, in this other group that wasn't so productive, \\[...\\] even though there was maybe the formality, there wasn't a space actually of creative difference. Versus when there is in a research group, which might even be quite... maybe sometimes even egoic, but I'm not sure. In the good research groups that's actually one of the funny things is, even if people have got big egos, the egos in terms of what you're doing is sort of put to the side, you know, you're committed to the scientific mission. And I just kind of-- I know my question is not so clear. But how does one, even in the lowest sense of this, allow not to be pulled apart like you've described, but also not to become like flatland where like, you know, oh, everyone has equal listening to, everyone's view is equally valid, because yes, everyone's view is equal, like we want to listen to everyone in a true sense of listen, but at some point, how do we deal with tensions or conflicts? Like that's, I guess my other question would be: when have you had a group \\[which\\] has had a lot of tension like the COVID group, and has successfully synergized?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:19:43\n\nI have had this experience also. And I think the point is a completely different one. It's not about everyone being equal. It's not even about everyone being heard, although this is a virtue, which I find important. It's even not a shared mission, although I find this is important also, it can help. But they also can be in the way, by the way. What I would emphasise is, again, this mysterious thing called the field, or the wholeness between us. To be aware that there's something alive between us, that's more than the sum of the parts. That has its wholeness. And I find something that really makes a difference here -- at least the way we do this, there may be other ways of how to go about this -- \\[is\\] to create awareness of this dialogical field. Of this energetic field. And not an intellectual awareness, \\[but\\] an experiential awareness: that one really can sense into the aliveness of this, to speak in semi-mythological language, that you can look through the eyes of this energetic space itself, you're not just looking through the Thomas eyes, or Rufus eyes, but I'm able to look through the eyes of the space itself. And what I find very powerful, at least for myself, is to really have a real love relationship with this. So there is something that is very powerful in groups, which I would call interpersonal relationship. So that I'm not just me, and you are an instrumental part of my reality. But I honour you and I honour her and I honour him. And this is a very important foundation of a real relationship in a dialogical field. But this is, I would say, an interpersonal experience, where I'm aware of you and her and him and the network of us in that. But it's not the wholeness itself. The way I would talk about this field consciousness, I would call it this emergent interbeing. It has its own life form to say. I mean, I'm speaking semi-mythologically to make a point here. And to be aware of its needs in that situation, what does this relation field really need from me and from you, and my capacity to hold the relationship with this emergent interbeing field, and our shared capacity to do that allows us to hold the tension between us in a way that we don't fracture and where it's not even, again, the point is not that we, in the end, love everything everyone is saying. It can stay in friction, it can be productive, it can be creative, or we can agree and find something that's... but everything that kind of synergizes in this not kind of 'everything is nice and everything is equal' way, but it can be very complex, difficult, all kinds of stuff. But there's a love for this experienced wholeness of this emergent interbeing field that allows us to anchor us in that and to hold us so that this becomes creative and does not fall apart.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:23:32\n\nAnd can you give a concrete example where this hadn't happened in this time of COVID with this group? Where is the example when you've seen that happen, when there was quite a tense topic. And where there were differences, but it was able to be held in this way. And what the result was. Do you have an example, even from EnlightenNext, you know, \\[...\\] just to kind of get really concrete. Were there tensions in EnlightenNext that got resolved through this kind of dialogue? Or things you've seen in recent times where you've seen this really play out?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:24:12\n\nEnlightenNext is a different story because--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:24:14\n\nThen let's leave that one for the moment, but just any example you could give me concretely if you have a topic that you think you can describe, \\[where for example\\] these people have these quite different views, or I had this different view, \\[...\\] but this was actually the result, like by \\[being\\] able to hold the field like that.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:24:29\n\nI mean, in some way, this is my ongoing experience in doing our magazine, where we have sometimes very different perspectives on--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:24:48\n\nCan you make it, just on this one, just give me a concrete difference and it could be just the simplest thing like we wanted to have this as the lead story or that, but a concrete example where this came up where two people in the magazine had really different perspectives. And then what happened? Like, if you did this interaction and the field was held? This was the resolution?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:25:10\n\nLet me go back to this retreat decision, because we really had in that very different views if, at this point, going to Turkey was something that we should do. Or if it's even a problem to do something, or if there's a need of \\[something\\] different and we had no answer for this for a couple of weeks. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:25:45\n\nAnd so what happened? What would one person say? You don't have to name them, but \\[for example\\] Person X thought that we should go to Turkey strongly and Person Y... you know, like, what actually happened? Like people would get on a call, and they would just...\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:26:03\n\nI'm just a little cautious to not talk about too intimate things here. In that sense, even without naming names. But there were different focus points. People who were more focused on creating for people a nice experience somewhere, and people who were more kind of thinking about a more strategic context where this retreat has to, or can, serve a certain function in developing what we're doing, and where the personal experience on the rigidity is important, but it's not the whole context. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:26:03\n\nRight. \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:26:06\n\nAnd at the same time, both sides are right somehow. There's a big, you can call it strategic context, how a retreat serves a bigger cause, and it has a certain function and a certain thing that you want to try and bring to the world. And there are certain life experiences that you bring to people who join this that you want to support. And they can be very in contrast to each other, opposing each other.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:27:38\n\nSo it could have been a breakdown, it could have been \\[that\\] these two camps formed and kind of slugged it out, and maybe even whatever resolution would have -- there might have been no resolution -- but even if there had been a resolution, people would have been conquered or dissatisfied, one group would have-- Whereas instead, you're saying there was a group decision that was made relatively efficiently. And \\[...\\] it was an integrative decision that built on this field to find something that people were really whole with.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:28:10\n\nI mean, what we tend to do -- and this is a language that we don't use, but other groups use that and I find it applicable -- is that the decision process is consensus-oriented. And consensus-oriented does not mean that in the end, everyone kind of has the same perspective. But that we are behind what we do in the end together.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:28:42\n\nI mean, Amazon's founder famously has this phrase, 'Disagree and commit'.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:28:49\n\nYes, exactly. But for that, you have to be very aware of a lot of factors to be able to do that. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:28:55\n\nYes. \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:28:56\n\nAnd \\[...\\] there has to be a lot of freedom from one's own agenda. Particularly to do what you're describing: to disagree but be behind it. Because, whatever, it seems to be the right thing, although I still disagree. Maybe the reason \\[is\\] because it cannot be decided, and it's more important that we move together here than to fracture. And because of that, although I still see differently, I'm really behind doing this, because -- and then maybe it connects directly again to our work -- I'm aware of this relational field and I don't want to hurt it. So just to make the point clear, it's not that I don't want to hurt each other; that can be part of it. But I don't want to hurt the potential of this field. But this field... what is relevant here right now and the way we can see this together, that only can find itself in not fragmenting. And to hold this together and to value that needs first essential awareness of its reality, that it's not just an abstract idea that I can contemplate, but it's, this is much more existential. Because if I just contemplate it as an idea, that then basically all becomes a head thing. But if I have an existential experience of this wholeness, we are talking on a very different level.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:30:44\n\nI want to encourage anyone listening -- it's, really, this is a practice \\[...\\] -- really, to practise. And I think it talks to things we all know, which is that we spend much of our time not in such productive-- well, in debate or not productive dialogue. I wanted to switch tracks right towards the end here and ask a couple of other questions. So one is: what was EnlightenNext, because I think there is a lot of inspiration for people wanting to cr-- you know, in many ways it sounds like an incredible community. I've heard testimony from other people who've been participating. But it also broke down. What were lessons of that? Or like, what happened? Because I think this is a moment when people have a lot of ideas about, again, we want more transformative communities. What did you take from that experience as something that we could... what was the source of breakdown? What can we learn about, I don't know, whatever you want to speak to there? But yeah, anything there that you'd like to talk to? Because I think it has a lot of lessons for people today.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:31:55\n\nYou have another hour? A couple? I mean, there's a lot we can say. Just maybe one thing why I think that in the end, it fell apart?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:32:11\n\nYeah. \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:32:13\n\nI think it fell apart... Again, \\[there are\\] many, many things that one can bring into it; I'll just pick one that I think is very central. There was a built-in contradiction between what was our project, what we tried to do, and the way we did it, because this capacity of interrelated emergence basically needs that this dialogical field really comes into the lead. But we did it in a top-down context of basically a guru context where the power structure was outside of the project. And that would have needed a complete redo of our relations in order for this dialogical field to come to its own. And--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:33:29\n\nSo, just concretely, so for people who are listening, like Andrew Cohen was the guru...\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:33:35\n\nWhy did that not happen? Andrew Cohen was the guru and basically, it was a top-down power structure where this dialogical field that we are talking about was... somehow this was what we were interested in, and also what Andrew was interested in in some way. But to do that, to basically let go of this guru position would have been a necessity for this dialogical field to come to dawn. And that did not happen. Again, I could say more about it, but... simply because Andrew didn't want to. And how you interpret this--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:34:03\n\nI guess one question I have is, do you think he was essential? Like, the question is: why is it so difficult for groups to self-generate? Why is it so often it is a guru to ge--? Like, what role... Why was... Was he quite central to it then coming into being in the first place? And why did he not see... Well, who knows for him why he didn't see the wisdom of stepping aside, but I guess this kind of difficulty, I guess, is: do you need something like that to create the space in the first place, but then somehow step out of the way?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:34:53\n\nYeah, I guess that's one of the lessons one can draw. That is part of the difficulty of it, because of course, it helps also to have a powerful holder of this. But the nature of this different step of human interrelatedness needs something different than pyramid power structures. And I'm not saying that authority is bad, because--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:35:25\n\nYes. \n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:35:26\n\n\\--to flatland everything is also not the answer. So yes, how to do this in a dialogical way, and to honour authority and expertise at the same time, in a flexible way of honouring who we are also in our differences... That's demanding. It's not easy. And that's why this also produces a lot of experiments that fail. But that's also part of the process. And we are in the process of finding out how we can do that, to honour a lot of contradicting things at the same time. Because I don't think that pyramid structures really can serve for the future. And postmodern, flatland non-hierarchies are incapable also. So what is the integration? And I also have no real problem with failing because I think failing is part of the success in the end.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:36:33\n\n\\[...\\] So to come to a sort of related question that we come back to... you know, Integral, Ken Wilber, and the Integral room is much bigger than Ken Wilber and involves many, many people who've contributed. What are the lessons again of that? I mean, I am someone who's kind of come to it a bit later, you know, in the last few \\[years\\]. But what... I mean, I think that if you Google, the top hit for Ken Wilber or something is this essay by Manson. The guy, I think, who wrote this sort of self-help book, but who's obviously really inspired by Ken Wilber. But \\[the article is\\] called The Rise and Fall of Ken Wilber, or something, and he starts the article: 'he's like the greatest genius you've never heard of'. But again, I don't want to-- I don't necessarily think that-- I think that we have a tendency in our world to focus on things that are successful, because there's an entity that's really visible, that's really successful, you know; things that are successful because they influence the entire culture are not so. But what do you see has happened with the Integral community? What are your hopes? And where do you think it's evolving to? Where is it showing up in other places? And what lessons are there that other communities, which are coming into being, that are emerging, could learn from that?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:37:53\n\nAgain, one simple answer to a very complex question. I'm very happy about the emergence of Metamodern. And one reason why I am: because I think that any new stage of human culture and consciousness has to be multilingual. And that the emergent existence of Metamodern -- also partly in competition with Integral, partly in identity -- in my understanding is a support of Integral because it allows whatever this new stage in culture and consciousness is about, to find different voices in also hopefully friendly competition, to analyse what it is and not just coming from one source. So, in that sense, I really think that Integral becoming polyphone is a support of Integral. And that Ken has here a monumentous role in what happened and what he brought about and that he has his own genius and that for me is unquestioned and of course he has also his limitations and his downsides. But, I mean, he played an enormous role in my life, that's maybe beside the point, but that really shaped a lot of my life and my understanding of reality. I think that to honour this and to find a polyphonic relationship to that, as every stage of consciousness, tradition, modern, postmodern, came in different voices and competing voices is a support that there's something really new happening right now. And some people call it Integral. Some people call it Metamodern. And some people will find it a third name for that. And I think that's good. \n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:40:10\n\nAnd what do you think a key...? What is the kind of essence...? I give the analogy sometimes for people in discussing this of the Reformation leading into the Enlightenment -- the great last transition, you might say, if you reflect -- and let's say, the Reformation, which I think is actually a key point and you can go early Renaissance, but in essence was actually sort of an individuality, like, you know, each person found their way to God. So, you know, by Scripture alone, etc. There were, and it's a good example, there were many, many different Protestant sects. There were many different people with different views. But there were certain key commonalities, maybe, fundamentally, to, for example, Protestantism, and then ultimately, there are many different takes on some degree aspects of modernity. But they had this kind of... they were common. So as I said, one individual route to God or, you know, the importance of reading for oneself, the Bible: these were common aspects. So you got the Quakers all at one end, and you got, I don't know, the Anglicans... there's a huge spectrum. I know--\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:41:22\n\nLuther and Calvin, being two voices that had a lot not in common, but at the same time--\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:41:29\n\nYeah, and a lot not in common. So I guess when I hear Wilber or Integral speak, it would be stuff like there was a unifying principle -- that's my point, there's a lot of divergence, but the key principle, let's say, in Integral would be just the assumption of the possibility of human growth, consciousness growth and evolution, the reality of that. And that there's no end, like it's not like we've got the right answer to this kind of aspect. I don't know, maybe I'm not putting that rightly, but what would you say? Are there any underlying core principles, though, which many polyphonic voices are maybe versions of? But what are kind of core assumptions, like the Protestants have certain core assumptions that you can identify?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:42:09\n\nWhat comes to my mind? First is one thing. And that is the integration of the Modern impulse and the Postmodern impulse into something new. Because, at least in my understanding, Post-Modernity is not really a new stage in consciousness. Post-Modernity is Modernity in the face of self-critique. It's the deconstruction of Modernity. It's not the new yet. At least, one could argue this point.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:42:53\n\nIt's like Scholasticism. Medieval Scholasticism was a kind of integration at the beginning, but into the old system of the discovery of Plato, Aristotle. But it wasn't... yes, it was a kind of critique or building on, but not yet the next stage.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:43:11\n\nSo in this impulse to really take serious what Post-Modernity is teaching us in terms of the flaws of the Western scientistic, hyper-individualistic, separate, subject-object divide perspective of reality that distinguishes -- I'm oversimplifying dramatically, forgive me -- \\[that\\] distinguishes this western, Greek, European impulse from traditional impulses and other impulses of other cultures around the world, and that created the triumph and the disaster of modernity. And postmodernity is very much basically the relentless self-critique of that. And Integral/Metamodern is a way to acknowledge this critique, for example, the subject-object divide of the Modern perspective. Also, the reduction to materialism, to basically that only things that we can measure with scientific methodologies are accepted as being reality and everything that shows up just in its phenomenological form is not real. All these kinds of things that Modernity and the Modern did for us is very flawed, but, at the same time, to acknowledge again the dignity of this Modern impulse and find this in new forms of holding bigger complexities, where this can be brought together, seems to be one \\[thing\\] that these different forms of Integral and Metamodern try to achieve in similar or different ways.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:45:14\n\nSo that integrating of the Modern, like respecting reason -- so, neither throwing out the baby with the bathwater, sort of keeping the baby of Modernity, the value of reason, the value of meritocracy, the value of expertise, even, you know, material developments. While also integrating the great critique of that. \\[...\\] It's odd because Post-Modernism doesn't really have quite the interiority, the respect for... But maybe  I'm being unfair to Post-Modernism. The point is that we're integrating certainly the spiritual line back into things, integrating a phenomenological and the inner world into things. That it. So it's kind of funny, because you might say that it's the time for the birth of a new whole religion, or a spiritual thing that integrates that. And I know many people talk to that. I talked about it before. And, I know, many others in this space. And Ken -- one of his most recent books is The Religion, I think, Of Tomorrow or The Religion of the Future. So I guess that impulse, that integration is a key aspect. Is there anything else you see as a key aspect of these different polyphonic voices? If we were to write out our theses?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:46:41\n\nIt's interesting because I think it's central. But I may be biased because it's so much where my focus on it is. And in Integral, it's only partially developed. But I think, to develop a perspective of reality that is beyond the separate, individual self-sense seems to be part of the equation here. But I'm a little hesitant to say that because on one hand this is so dear to my heart. And on the other hand, I see it in certain forms of Integral only half-heartedly pursued in that, but, still, my conviction is that this is a central part of the puzzle.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:47:41\n\nAnd finally, I guess, what are the things we could learn, like with everything, what have the limitations been of the Integral... maybe movement or community or practices? \\[...\\] They may even be recognised in the community. \\[...\\] But what if we were like, 'What can we learn from the last thirty, forty years of Integral's efforts?' The successes and the things that haven't worked so well. Like other groups, you know, and other movements. I mean, I know Craig Walsh wrote this 2007, I think, address to the European Integral Congress or something like that. But it was like, Ken is very clear in the work, but, you know, it can be quite heady. He himself had a very strong practice. But Craig mentioned, I think, in his address, like, we really need to make sure we're doing the work, the inner work, the actual practice, rather than this just being ideas. That's one thing that I can see in any, you know, I see for myself, I can see in any group that it's often quite easy to be like, 'oh, yeah, we've got all these great ideas' -- you know, it's true of any political movements -- but then it's not the practice. Going back to your first point of this whole call, we're not practising what we're preaching and that's crucial. Is that one thing? Or what other things would you say that there are that we can really learn to do even better? That were being done well and can be done even better? Or that we're maybe missing, have not done...?\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:49:10\n\nNo, I think you've pointed it out. And I really think one of the flaws and blind spots, and maybe even the shadow sides, of Integral is the temptation of the theory that explains everything. Because there is a temptation, and I saw this in many cases, particularly in young, intelligent men, to kind of be so drawn into this capacity to put everything into maps. So that basically, you only live in maps anymore. And I see this, sometimes, to my experience, \\[as\\] very tragic. Because I see people who have deep spiritual longing, but from my perspective, \\[they're\\] completely lost in maps. When I see them, my experience is, they don't see anything but maps, even when they see you, all they can do is mapping you. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but because of the powerful capacity of these maps, they've lost touch with everything else. And this is something that happened because of the capacities of Integral theory. And because there can be a trap, you can be trapped in. And I seek... Again, it's just my perspective. But I really experience quite some tragic lives in this, where I see very sad people with high intelligent and high spirit longing, but somehow lost in this. And that is something, I think, which is connected to a blind spot, or to a shadow side of how Integral showed up until now. And again, I don't think there's anything on earth that does not show up with bias or positionality.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:51:22\n\nWow. Well, I mean, I think also that humility is a really central point as well. But not coupled with then doing nothing. Like, there's this dance, and you say we hold our view, but we hold it with a listening for others. I wanted to say at this point, anything last you'd like to say during this interview, Thomas, that you'd like to share at the very end, or anything that we haven't covered that you'd like to mention.\n\n**Thomas Steininger** 1:51:52\n\nNo, just I appreciate very much the conversation that we had, and to all this very theoretical, but also very personal dimension of this. And this shared search, how can we find the step forward in our individual practice and but also in our, if I may call it activism, to find more integrative forms of culture, and living together on this planet, with this planet? And kind of having this conversation is for me part of the practice.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:52:28\n\nWell, thank you so much. Thank you, everyone, for listening. And please, if you want to find out more about Thomas's work, you can check out Evolve and Evolve World. And, yeah, just a great thank you to you. And also I just want to acknowledge your partner, Elizabeth, who I knew unfortunately couldn't make it today, but was here in presence with us on this. Just acknowledging all of her contribution. And the many others. You've already acknowledged some of your kind of intellectual and spiritual ancestors on this call. So thank you to them as well.

I'm very excited about this conversation. Yeah, it always depends where one wants to set the starting point. But if you really go way back to when I was studying philosophy at the University of Vienna, I was, at that time, very much a social activist. I was in the student parliament, the anti-nuclear movement was strong - I was in part of all of that - and I was very much interested in social change at that time, from a left-wing perspective. And I felt in all this kind of social activism that we did at the time that something was really going wrong. And, from what I would say afterwards, there was a lot of ego involvement in the way we went about with our ideas of how to change the world. So I kind of changed course in that and did a lot of psychotherapy, group therapy, did a lot of what was in the 80s kind of things to do in body-oriented therapy, encounter, Gestalt therapy, breathwork, and all this kind of stuff. And I realized that there was a perspective opening up in myself that was different than my social activist identity. And I, being a philosopher, I tried to read about it, and there was a lot of spiritual literature. And to be honest, I hated the spiritual literature because it was often beautiful but I felt that people don't really think. I had the arrogance, at least, of a philosopher that the people didn't really think. And then in the 80s, I found something, or someone, that really was for me an important life change experience. That was the early Ken Wilber. And the early Ken Wilber - in the 1980s, at least in Vienna, nobody knew Ken Wilber - was able to think about social historic realities from a deep consciousness perspective. And I, at the end of my studies, wanted to write my thesis about social change, the evolution of culture, from a deep consciousness perspective, and I wrote about this with a lot of what at that time the early Ken Wilber brought to the table, which was already evolution of consciousness and deep philosophical understanding of a deep dimension of reality that I drew from Martin Heidegger, his whole relationship between being and beings. And this kind of interest and in-depth understanding of who we are, the subject-object divide, led me into being involved in more spiritual work. And, in a spiritual community that I was involved in, mainly in the 90s, there was a work where we very much were looking into what does it mean to come together in a different way in a dialogical form. And this work was the starting work of our dialogue forms that we did. This community broke apart, there's a lot of things I could tell about that, but if you want to have a starting point, this kind of long story is kind of a starting point of how all this work started in my life.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 05:41\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Wow.

So just one short question first, about that fascinating odyssey, what was it that had you see in the activism work that there was something missing personally, for you? You know, was there any specific incident? Where did this feeling come from? Because I would guess that many other people you were involved with didn't go on that journey, through therapy or through this kind of spiritual inquiry.

I could point to many things, but maybe, to pick one that was central for me, because our engagement at that time, our typical interest in the 1970s, 1980s, was very much anti-establishment power, against power structures, capitalism, old-fashioned power, but the way we acted between ourselves in all these student groups and university was very power-driven. There, the power dynamics were so much part of ourselves, that there was a huge contradiction between our understanding of having the longing for liberation and equality and people coming together, and the deep investment in just usual power struggles, equal investments and the power game, as you see it everywhere. And this conflict between our big ideals and the reality of how we lived between each other, and myself included by the way, was something that was bothering me. And there was a deep sense that something was missing. And on the other hand, that was part of what my dissertation was about, it was our understanding in this liberation movement about human alienation at that time, it was very much that alienation had to do with the production process with our capitalist societies, and all of that. And it felt for me that our being alienated from reality, from nature, from each other must go deeper than that; that's not the core of it. And in particular, more or less materialistic approach to this seems to be lacking a lot. And that's where the psychotherapy processes opened up for me and brought very deep experiences that also didn't fit to my kind of more down-to-earth naturalistic understanding of reality, so I had to deal with experiences with myself, and integrate them in my own understanding.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 08:50\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So I just want to highlight that\\u2026 maybe just as I think, for myself\\u2026 to summarise it, one point was that in the very movements that were often yearning for liberation, for kind of solidarity, for a kind of form of participation without oppression, without domination\\u2026 You know, I think what we mean by power structures, often, in that terminology, is kind of domination structures, you know, that's the power stance of that maybe. And this contradiction that you were seeing between the aspirations of the movement then the way that people were behaving, including yourself if you like, inside it. And the point that I think is most interesting is at the end, though, just there, you had this very insightful point, which is that while some people would have been, at that time, like, 'well, we're like this because, you know, we've been brought up inside a capitalist system and we've been sort of formed and we're just kind of reproducing these structures of oppression that have been imprinted on us. While there may be truth in that you also saw that some of this alienation from ourselves, from nature, from each other, went deeper, I would say ontologically, it was like an ontological aspect, more than just a structuralist aspect of it, that it went into our being or nature of our being, which, of course, is formed in society. I just want to flag that maybe we can come back to it or we can explore now, this question is really profoundly ongoingly relevant to all transformative projects, especially obviously, transformative political projects. And, you know, if we just talk that through for our audience, is that crudely I would say one story about the world is like, 'hey, we're going to transform things technologically, even our own being, we're going to invent pills, we're going to take a pill for that, you know, we're going to be a brave new world where you take this or you take out or you go to a movie that stimulates this or that, but we're going to, we're going to transform even our own being and our own well being almost technologically'. And another one, which is the traditional you might say Marxist or just generally, is like, 'okay, there's structures, we don't own the means of production, or, you know, we live in oppressive family structures that reincorporate the domination with the father over everyone else, or whatever. And if we break those structures, or transform those structures, if we create shared ownership of the means of production, or we reorder the nuclear family into a much better one, this alienation and this suffering in ourselves will kind of be transformed. And then finally, there's what I would call and we could discuss together, I don't know how you would call it, I'd be very interested, but an ontological emphasis, which is say, 'yes, those other aspects are, of course, relevant - technological and structural - but really, the fault, or the pathway, lies in ourselves. There's something deep in our human psychology that is transformable. There are practices, there are methods, but really there are deep things in humans that lead us to be alienated or to have suffering. And that remains, obviously, a really relevant question and distinction for ongoing projects of political or social transformation or personal transformation. I've kind of set that out, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Is that what you were alluding to? Or in your way, how would you put it? And how does that relate to what you see still today, or even then, in your evolution?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Thomas Steininger\"}),\" 12:47\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`I mean, it has a lot to do with identity, with who do we identify being, in that sense. And even in this time that we are talking about now, in the 1980s, I had a very powerful experience that made a big difference that maybe speaks to that. In effect it was a spiritual seminar, it was called Enlightenment Intensive. And it's a very simple setting. It was a week and we were sitting in a couple of circles, and you were only doing one thing: you were with a partner, always changing, and one partner asks you one question ongoingly, \"who are you?\" And then you have five minutes to answer. And then it changes. So basically, the whole week, you just go with this one question, who are you? Who are you? And it really becomes interesting when you slowly run out of answers. When you have said everything who you are - a man, Austrian, da da da, activist, da da da - and you have said this already 10 times, something is loosening in your system and things become a little wobbly in that. And there is a point at least that happens for many and happened for me, where you lose deeply a sense of who you think you are. And something is opening up that is you, but you can't name it and it's meaningful. And of course, this is very much related to the meditation experience - big meditation seminars or the meditation tradition I think is very much also around this liberation from identity - and that was something that broke something open in me - not only that but that was part of the process - that still stays with me, where I think, if we use this big word liberation, there is something in our human soul where the capacity to develop an inner freedom from our identification allows us to be here with each other in a very different way. And if you call this 'spiritual justice' there, then this little opening in yourself, or maybe big opening in yourself, seems to be a very profound foundation for a different understanding of who we are as humans, and how we can be together as humans. And, of course, a lot of things changed since this Enlightenment Intensive workshop in Vienna, at the time, but it still speaks to what is important to me.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 16:01\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"To put it in simple words, that kind of liberation, from identity, has a sense of being available at any time or any place.

So to move on, so you read Ken Wilber, it had this really big impact, and then, I'd like to talk a little bit more, you said you joined this kind of community in the 90s and that there were certain things that broke down.

It was around the spiritual teacher Andrew Cohen. And one thing that I still appreciate, and what our work in the core was very much about, was that liberation, also spiritual liberation, it's more important what happens between us than just what happens in me. The work we were doing, and that's still very much related to the work that I'm doing now, was very much finding a way to talk with each other, where, using your word that you just brought it, where we are just available. Something, let's call it, the potential of the moment, is opening up because nobody puts him or herself in the way with identification - we don't have to call it ego identification, it's basically the same thing in my understanding - where one can be so there for this moment, that we can be so there for this moment, that this moment has a chance to show up between us with the potential that it does not have if everyone is clinging on to 'I have to be here', 'you have to be here' and 'my agenda has to come through', 'your agenda has to come through'. But all this doesn't have to completely disappear, one can be there, in fact we have to talk about how it's important also for the individual to be here, but for the individual to be here in a way that one is free from one's identification with one's separate individuality [and that] allows a different dimension to open up. And we did a lot of our work about it. One thing that was one of our major moments, it had a year-long grow log, but then some of us, something like 30 of us, at this time we were living at the East Coast, Massachusetts in\\xA0 the countryside, we were for a period of more than three months, only meditating, nothing but meditating, and coming in this kind of dialogues. So we did nothing, but, I don't know how many hours, eight hours, ten hours meditation per day, for months, and every day we would come together in this kind of what we at that time called enlightened communication, and the goal was to be there without being locked into your ego, let's put it that way. And however you want to see that or analyse that, there are many things one can say about that, there was in particular one moment which was just very powerful, something was really breaking open that still is important to me, although a lot of things broke apart since then and we were not ego-free, liberated people all after that, but there was something liberating that was very meaningful and showed the different possibility of humans being together that was part of this work in this EnlightenNext community.

You know, that I can really see that, and that there's something in my ego, there is something that is opening up a spaciousness in myself, where maybe a disidentification with those things. I mean, I want to say for myself is the things we've done that aren't so nice, I always sometimes have said that, you know, I think the hardest thing is to have been, if I were a rapist, to really be able to be with that. Not to make it okay or anything like that, but we always have such self-image of how we were good, or, you know, the ideal of ourselves, and to be able to somehow hold that and not 'oh, it doesn't matter', but somehow stepping back from it creates this space around so many things, because we so identify with our positions, including our positions about who we are like, whatever they might be, you know, like, I'm smart, I'm good, or that I'm not good, or whatever those are and so I really see that.

And let me talk about the magic that you brought up. I would say it is magic. But what I mean with that is, or to explain myself, I think that individuation is also magic. One very down-t- earth understanding of magic is what we create with language. I find it magic when I use a word, like the word tree, and I'm pretty sure that in your consciousness somehow something like treeness shows up. That's the foundational form of magic, to be able to manifest something to language. And since we started to use language in human history, we also started magic. Magic and the start of language happened pretty much at the same time in that sense. And the fact that we were able as a species - to step back a little bit and take a meta perspective here which I think explains something - that we were able to basically leave our embeddedness in the natural process that we were in and shared with all other natural species, that we were able first to form identities as a tribe, this particular cultural forms, and it was all done with language into, starting with different forms of storytelling, coming in the hero story, all of a sudden there was the creation of the individual that stands out of the indigenous tribe, it has its own onus and the basic story form of the hero is the one who stands against the embeddedness, embeddedness with nature, embeddedness with the gods and goddesses and finds his onus. With Odysseus, or Ulysses, Homer did an amazing piece basically showing our Western, Greek, European individuation process. How Ulysses basically is able to fool the gods with the forces around him to basically enforce his own individuation, his own heroic existence, in that. That is a form of magic that he created and that created our whole culture, at least our European, Modernist culture, it's based on a certain perspective that we hold with this language, it's based on the separation that we kind of manifest, that I am myself and I'm related to objects and even other people I can objectify and can have instrumental relation [with], it's a whole world that we are creating through a cultural magical game, that even science in this form creates this magic, as a scientific language. That creates a certain awareness of reality that's based on subject-object relationship, subjectivity, instrumentality to create this world that we created as a species, as a culture. And maybe we are at a turning point right now where this game comes to its own end. There in the hyper individuation process, and the whole epidemics of narcissism, the shadow sides of this game are showing so strongly that there is an evolutionary drive to find new forms of free integration in wholeness. This experience that I was describing of a relational field, is maybe an attempt to not lose individuality, but to create an awareness that even individuality is embedded always in relationship, and to have a psychological, emotional, spiritual relationship to this embeddedness and then you give it the word field to express this. But of course, it's not a physical field or whatever, you use a word to express something that somehow has a relationship to a certain experience, that has some resonance with the experience. And that, I think, is something that is happening right now, in many places, not only in the spiritual community that we were in, but in many places, that it seems that our hyper individual, postmodern world is looking for forms of free integration. Thich Nhat Hanh's interbeing, reinterpreting Buddhism with this interbeing language, goes, from my interpretation, in the same direction in some way other people do similar work in that. So there seems to be something in the air, where the evolution of culture and consciousness is seeking, magically, to find new language games, to talk with Wittgenstein, that allows us to experience and communicate our embeddedness. And that's how I would interpret this experience. Sorry, it was a long answer, and a little philosophical one.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 45:53\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:`Yes, let's talk about the magic.\\xA0 It's great. So I want to come back to that, let's work that through for myself and maybe for listeners, and I think maybe also to expand on it in examples of what we mean by these terms like individuation and then integration. So I maybe want to bring another example that we're all familiar with, well which we all went through whether we remember it, but we might know if we've seen babies. So as a tiny child, when a child is born, from what we know and obviously, we can't really interview very young children, but we can do kind of experiments to understand how they see the world. They may not really see themselves as separate from the world, like they kind of are the world that they're in and a really tiny one-week- or a few-month-old baby is their sensations and doesn't have a sense of their body separate from the environment and things like that. And there's a sense, I'm picking an analogy, but you were also using it in the grand historical perspective, which I want to come back to, but there's a sense of individuation in a child as they start to see themselves as separate, like, there's some kind of distinction of them. And that's a very natural, and even healthy, phenomenon. And what you're also talking about, I'm just kind of trying to get that for people to understand individuation, there's a sense of, at one point the child is totally embedded in their environment, in a sense. Similarly, while again we can't go back in a time machine and go back 50,000 years or 100,000 years or even 10,000 years and really understand, or interview Homo Sapiens and understand how they see the world. There is a sense in a historical perspective, from the literature we have, from what we do know, and even from societies we know today, like indigenous, that there wasn't the sense of the individual distinct from who they were interwoven with the group. And what we're talking to here is that there's been, there's a suggestion, that there's been a big historical process, which is both a victory and, as we just discussed, has many shadows, of individuation, what that means, just like the child stops being just 'I am one with the environment', in an actually healthy way, they see 'ah I've got a boundary of my body', that there are objects in another sense. For example, very, very young children, if you do experiments, don't really, if an object disappears, for them, it's just gone out of existence, they don't search for it, it's gone, if I hide something behind the chair. And at some point the child realises there are objects out there, as it were, \"in the world\" that can disappear and that they can search for, they can recover, that are separate from them. I'm giving the very concrete examples from developmental literature. But this sense of individuation goes on. And, first of all, just if there's anything you want to say, to do better than me in kind of setting that up, and then there's a sense of which that has extended, that's become, we'll come to I think in a moment, this era we're in that has become so exaggerated or taken to such extremes, that the shadows of it have become very apparent, though we should acknowledge the great victory. But first, was there anything you want to say just to kind of spell out individuation. And I think this is really profound, again, it comes back to the ontological theme, but also really talks actually deeply, if people are listening, to think to how this relates to some of the predicaments, like concrete things like we talked about, like narcissism, but also what's going on with our political systems or our challenges of dealing with global crises like the ecological crisis, the climate crisis. I also want to end, I'm just flagging this for people, I want to come back to, one modern reaction, say, 'Oh, we want to go back'. We want to go back to the wisdom of indigenous cultures, which have huge amounts of wisdom, but in some of the story here is it's not one wants to go back, it's like the pendulum will swing, but it doesn't swing back, the pendulum is moving upwards, we're tracing, if you like, a helix upwards, so I want to come to all of those things. But I just want to start with the individuation point just to explain that for people, because it's a kind of a technical term and I know it relates to Jung and other things. What do we mean by individuation?`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Thomas Steininger\"}),\" 54:02\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Thank you for that.

But what you're describing, I think is also common knowledge. We know that and of course, people like Piaget really\\u2026 that's what their work is about, to describe these changes that you are describing. And one thing that all of us know besides the examples that you just brought is when a child I think at the age of around three starts to change language and not talks anymore about oneself in the third person but the first person and just to see what it takes in consciousness to\\u2026 or what it means to talk about yourself in the third person is kind of a loose way that the identification process reaches a different firmness when you don't talk about him, but I talk about me. And then this meanness really starts. And this is also, as far as I know, where the first really rebellious phase in life happens, where you really start to try the boundaries of your parents. Because you encounter the choice of saying no, basically, 'Oh, no, no, no' and screaming because you want something\\u2026 all the willfulness\\u2026 you you're starting to experiment and play with your own willfulness in a way where we discover something that is our essence. And I really think what you are pointing out that often because we are aware that narcissism is such a theme of our time, and our disconnectedness is such a theme that we all suffer from, and the whole wave of indigenous renaissance that we are living through right now, expresses also that we realise that those cultures who have not gone through the same process of modality that we have gone through hold some forms of wisdom that we have lost. But there is a very simple example again, that I think highlights what you were pointing to. Because when we were not separate, yet, in our indigenous tribe, there was a real power and united togetherness. Also, by the way, togetherness with nature [is included] in this, we have not objectified each other and all of that and and that's partly [what] our romantic sense is responding to: 'wow, this is beautiful, this is powerful'. And this is true. But there's another element that's worth looking at: that this was not a choice. This was a given. Nobody could step out of the tribe, there was no freedom to step out of the tribe. Literally\\u2026 there are enough examples to demonstrate that people, indigenous, being taken out of the tribe die. And not because they starve or something like that, maybe that too. But psychologically, you just cannot take that you don't exist outside. So to see that this is powerful, but there's also a necessity built in and a lack of freedom to do anything else but that. That is a very different situation than we are in, that we can say no, I'm not part of the society. I'm not part of this culture. I'm not part of this family. And I really can do my thing. And it can be very narcissistic. But we also can make a choice to come together. But this togetherness is different, fundamentally different because it's based on our choosing capacity to do so. To to be aware that this kind of togetherness is based on the freedom to choose, that's very different than the factuality of just being together. It shows that this is not a going back to some romantic idea, but what I would call here trans-individuation, the rediscovery of our embeddedness in our togetherness, [which] is always based on our capacity of free choice, and also the responsibility to choose the right form of togetherness, because you can also choose the Nazi form of togetherness, and that's maybe something one can discuss if it's the right thing of coming together. So our form of responsibility of individuation and only with individuation as you will responsibility, for someone who is re-sponsible, forms a different way of this related, this field of relationship that's different than the indigenous one can learn a lot.

That shows up\\u2013 I'm giving formal examples in our kind of governmental\\u2026 but the kind of underlying ontological achievement that represents is, what you're saying is kind of massive, and almost not acknowledged and particularly in these moments because it is now gone, its shadows have arrived. And so just to acknowledge that, the great victory of that freedom, and it shows up even in victory today, which is, you know, many, many societies are and were patriarchal, you know, the victories of individuation are still being reaped, whether I think they relate, you know, many of these areas, to see people, as sovereign individuals with their own rights, and all these kinds of things. And the trauma, though, that we are still dealing with of that victory, and, well not that vic-, but also, you know, of dealing with the group and oppressions by the group, and so on. And what you're now coming to is to say, but we also see the great limitations of what we could call hyper individuation, you mentioned narcissism, but an atomized society, you know, the things we can say are kind of classic: loneliness, but also, our great, our lack of embeddedness, or connection, with nature in a visceral sense. The other thing that I want to reiterate in all of this is that we have to necessarily on a call like this, we can't really do practice, although I and Thomas can be kind of, I hope, practising a bit the concreteness of this. The visceralness of these things, in both directions. And so when we say, 'Oh, we're not embedded in nature,' I mean, in a way, I could have no idea of what it really means, although I grew up in the country, [I could have no idea of] what it really means to be connected, fully connected with nature, in a certain way, but that this is something that really is showing up today in the way that we act, the way that we behave, the way that we are, the way we operate. And I wonder, therefore, coming to one of the things that you're really looking at is ways that we're not necessarily going back because we can't, we don't, we cannot go back. In a sense, it's not the same thing. What is the going forward? So then that does come back \\u2013 this is what you've been describing even earlier in these experiences in these practices. And again, this magic, you said, is we're looking for ways really to integrate the victories of individuation, of our autonomy, of our individuality\\u2026 back, though, into something that is a collective but that isn't a reversal [\\u2026], it's something really where that autonomy and responsibility and sovereignty or something is preserved, yet there is something new that emerges and there is a sense of being the collective and connectedness and so on. Is that what the, that's what the work that you\\u2026?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Thomas Steininger\"}),\" 1:04:03\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Absolutely. To emphasise what you're pointing to, that is also what Ken Wilber calls the dignity of modernity, that we right now tend to forget, because we are so much in the drama of modernity right now. So, rightfully, we also have to emphasise how we move beyond that and also beyond the postmodern revolt against that, to integrate it on a higher level, but it has to be honoured, the dignity. It has to be seen, has to be in there. Otherwise, we end up with all kinds of regressions. So, this is a critical point to make. And what this really means ongoingly has to be found out on a theoretical level but also on the practical level. And to talk more from a practical level, I think that's at least what our Emergent Dialogue practice is focusing on that is developed out of that what we did in the 90s. And what we did afterwards in our work here a little bit peopled by Partner and others. Here, we are working this now, since, I think, it goes to 30 years now. And one simple way to understand what an anchor point can be to enter this different form of being together here is what I would call synergetic intuition. It sounds a little bit like a mouthful and a fancy word and I'll try to explain what I mean. But when we are, in whatever situation with whatever factors, let's have people and beyond people, there is a multitude that comes together and builds a situation. Let's say we are in a dialogue, and there are 10 people. And let's leave all the other factors out right now. Let's just focus on these 10 people, different perspectives, different life stories, different agendas, different drama points, different hopes. And there's a conversation that has a certain reason why we are here. And there is a multitude, and how does this multitude find a wholeness? How do we not stay fragmented or fragment so that I have no clue\\u2026 The worst thing is that we fight each other, but also just to be next to each other and have no real relationship is a form of fragmentation. That we as the circle of 10 people say [\\u2026] we just don't find the wholeness, a meaningful wholeness, that everyone knows when the conversation comes to its own and somehow it feels very meaningful, what we're talking about, and we're all in it, and something's happening. And it's beyond my agenda or your agenda. It's happening. There's some meaningful wholeness building, because we did something right, let's put it that way, or something right happened, however. And I think one word to understand this rightness is the beautiful word synergy. That 'synergy' means that different points, factors, identities, all look for how they can form a meaningful whole. And it makes a huge difference in any situation, when I'm interested, have a sense organ for this synergetic capacity of a situation, and I'm in support of it to show up or not. And when enough people in a room have a focus and the capacity to really [\\u2026] support this, synergy happens in a much more profound way, in a much more powerful way. And the potential between us gets multiplied just because we don't focus fragmentation. We focus on synergy and synergy does not mean that we fall into one. And there is no difference anymore. It is a creative relationship of difference, even greater friction, where I don't agree with you but there's something very powerful in this disagreement that's really interesting. We don't even have to agree in the end. But still, it was very enriching to have this conversation with you. If you agree or disagree, maybe both [are] a good outcome, but something synergized in this and the capacity to be there for this synergetic field is, I think, a way to understand what this form of being together holds in a way that I'm not primarily interested in me and my agenda and you and your agenda and debate or whatever. But we are together. We are here together for something that is a creative wholeness, that we still have to find out what it is.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:09:30\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And again, so if you, if I were thinking for myself, or listeners to think for themselves, it would be interesting to say let's just pick something simple.

This year, we wanted to go out of some reasons to a powerful place in Turkey. And then the war happened. And it just did not feel right. To go to a retreat in Turkey, it kind of felt like some escapist thing\\u2026 So a couple of us came together and just were expressing this, feeling uncomfortable with this. And out of this conversation came the idea, why don't we go to Berlin? Berlin is a city that holds so much. It's a symbol, the reality of division in our time, and also the creative response to division. So there's something very powerful in the place of that, and that just happened out of this conversation, then we had no idea how we were to do this. And we had some friends in Berlin, we started to talk. And to cut a long story short, we came up with some friends in a very powerful co-working, co-living space, and another friend who runs a community, in Berlin with young people, they call themself the Church of Interbeing\\u2026 and they, we, we said, let's do this together. And then we had a process where we just are in many Zoom calls. And then in a couple of days in Berlin, we just went from our places and talked: how do we do this retreat together? And everybody has their places. And somehow it felt [as though] nobody really designed this retreat. It was a conversation, where things fell into place. It was even not only a conversation between people, we also we went to different places and felt that the place told us something, how to do this. And this listening to this ongoing synergetic presence between us, the places and the idea, allowed in a very short time that a retreat unfolded and in the end was, at least from my sense, very powerful and very successful. But it really happened in its own emergence and listening to the unknown between us: how does this potential want to arrive here? And it was not someone having an agenda, let's do this. And it was really ongoingly being very open and in the unknown, and seeing, 'Oh, wow, this fits together, well, this fits\\u2013 no, this doesn't fit together'. Now, all of a sudden, it's a synergetic whole building, that in the end, I am just very happy how it happened. So that's was for me really an expression of a synergetic coming together, where none of us there over-invested and also there was no ego involved. But we were not overly invested in our ego, so that something powerful [could] emerge between us that was beyond ourselves and [that] in the end, I think, was really in service of the situation, the people involved and everything else.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:14:09\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And also, do you have a converse example of something you've ever experienced?

Which was put in a simple way, there was an event he was participating in. And he's also from a research background. You know, he was in academia, and the thing he really respected in academia was [\\u2026] particularly in research collaborations\\u2013 So his interest was when when you saw groups operating, like good research groups, because in academia, you can be in departments. And there's different reading groups, or different research groups, and some are really kind of not very functional, you know, and some are really productive. [\\u2026] And so that's just the context. And he was in a group and there was a lot of stuff about, like, everyone had to speak equally, and they were like asking a relatively expert question about like, how do you do research to assess, you know, something? And what he was noticing, which is something sometimes that happens today, and I'm asking this in this kind of question of dialogue, which is, you know, there was a kind of a bit of formality, like people felt like, everyone, you know, there's a question of who should speak, you know, who had power\\u2026 there are these things that come up. But even that there are differences of opinion? I guess, yeah, this question, which is, when you operate with a lot \\u2013 I'm not articulating this question super well, so I'm gonna kind of work it through, and we're going to make it a bit what we can\\u2026 What he was saying, what he saw in research groups was there was a tolerance for inequality of speaking or participation at given moments because someone had expertise. But the group had this core purpose, and that would dance, it wouldn't be someone who always\\u2013 In a given moment, it would be like, 'Okay, we got a statistics question. This person knows a lot about statistics.' But you could also have very strong differences of opinion, that would, at least in productive groups, there could be clashes, but it would somehow synergize and you would move on. I guess why I'm trying to bring this up is that what I'm hearing is that also, this isn't about being nice. This kind of practice of something emerging isn't about us all being like, oh, everyone's view is of equal validity. But there's somehow an ability to add, to kind of be with productive tension or creative tension. And in this group that kind of pulled apart\\u2013 like, I guess what it is is: what is it that allows the group to not have too much tension or be pulled apart versus\\u2026? You know, it sounds like when you did, [when] you're available, and everyone's kind of committed to the mission, [when] there's a general alignment, and even maybe cultural alignment, there are going to be differences, but there's enough kind of shared\\u2026 It's like, in this other group that wasn't so productive, [\\u2026] even though there was maybe the formality, there wasn't a space actually of creative difference. Versus when there is in a research group, which might even be quite\\u2026 maybe sometimes even egoic, but I'm not sure. In the good research groups that's actually one of the funny things is, even if people have got big egos, the egos in terms of what you're doing is sort of put to the side, you know, you're committed to the scientific mission. And I just kind of\\u2013 I know my question is not so clear. But how does one, even in the lowest sense of this, allow not to be pulled apart like you've described, but also not to become like flatland where like, you know, oh, everyone has equal listening to, everyone's view is equally valid, because yes, everyone's view is equal, like we want to listen to everyone in a true sense of listen, but at some point, how do we deal with tensions or conflicts? Like that's, I guess my other question would be: when have you had a group [which] has had a lot of tension like the COVID group, and has successfully synergized?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Thomas Steininger\"}),\" 1:19:43\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I have had this experience also.

It's even not a shared mission, although I find this is important also, it can help. But they also can be in the way, by the way. What I would emphasise is, again, this mysterious thing called the field, or the wholeness between us. To be aware that there's something alive between us, that's more than the sum of the parts. That has its wholeness. And I find something that really makes a difference here \\u2013 at least the way we do this, there may be other ways of how to go about this \\u2013 [is] to create awareness of this dialogical field. Of this energetic field. And not an intellectual awareness, [but] an experiential awareness: that one really can sense into the aliveness of this, to speak in semi-mythological language, that you can look through the eyes of this energetic space itself, you're not just looking through the Thomas eyes, or Rufus eyes, but I'm able to look through the eyes of the space itself. And what I find very powerful, at least for myself, is to really have a real love relationship with this. So there is something that is very powerful in groups, which I would call interpersonal relationship. So that I'm not just me, and you are an instrumental part of my reality. But I honour you and I honour her and I honour him. And this is a very important foundation of a real relationship in a dialogical field. But this is, I would say, an interpersonal experience, where I'm aware of you and her and him and the network of us in that. But it's not the wholeness itself. The way I would talk about this field consciousness, I would call it this emergent interbeing. It has its own life form to say. I mean, I'm speaking semi-mythologically to make a point here. And to be aware of its needs in that situation, what does this relation field really need from me and from you, and my capacity to hold the relationship with this emergent interbeing field, and our shared capacity to do that allows us to hold the tension between us in a way that we don't fracture and where it's not even, again, the point is not that we, in the end, love everything everyone is saying. It can stay in friction, it can be productive, it can be creative, or we can agree and find something that's\\u2026 but everything that kind of synergizes in this not kind of 'everything is nice and everything is equal' way, but it can be very complex, difficult, all kinds of stuff.

So, in that sense, I really think that Integral becoming polyphone is a support of Integral. And that Ken has here a monumentous role in what happened and what he brought about and that he has his own genius and that for me is unquestioned and of course he has also his limitations and his downsides. But, I mean, he played an enormous role in my life, that's maybe beside the point, but that really shaped a lot of my life and my understanding of reality. I think that to honour this and to find a polyphonic relationship to that, as every stage of consciousness, tradition, modern, postmodern, came in different voices and competing voices is a support that there's something really new happening right now.

And postmodernity is very much basically the relentless self-critique of that. And Integral/Metamodern is a way to acknowledge this critique, for example, the subject-object divide of the Modern perspective. Also, the reduction to materialism, to basically that only things that we can measure with scientific methodologies are accepted as being reality and everything that shows up just in its phenomenological form is not real.

I'm really happy today to be joined by Dr. Thomas Steininger. He has been cultivating transformative \"We Space\" practices for nearly 30 years. He is a philosopher, a practitioner, and a spiritual mentor and has dived deeply into the practice of meditation and into the exploration of the evolution of human consciousness, particularly the current transition from a hyperindividual \"I\" culture, to a co-conscious \"we\" culture. As an authority on cultural evolution and the different spiritual and religious currents that have formed our postmodern world, he brings this perspective into his work as publisher of Evolve magazine, the leading German magazine on consciousness and culture and as a faculty at Meridian University in California. He also co-founded and developed a process of emergent dialogue, and advanced practice in conscious communication. So really, really welcome, Thomas, to the show. I would like to start by just asking you a little bit about how you started this incredible journey over the last 30 plus years in this area? What was your original encounter? Was it during your studies, was it later? I'd love to hear a bit about your background and how this started.\n\nThomas Steininger 01:46\n\nThank you Rufus, glad to be here. I'm very excited about this conversation. Yeah, it always depends where one wants to set the starting point. But if you really go way back to when I was studying philosophy at the University of Vienna, I was, at that time, very much a social activist. I was in the student parliament, the anti-nuclear movement was strong - I was in part of all of that - and I was very much interested in social change at that time, from a left-wing perspective. And I felt in all this kind of social activism that we did at the time that something was really going wrong. And, from what I would say afterwards, there was a lot of ego involvement in the way we went about with our ideas of how to change the world. So I kind of changed course in that and did a lot of psychotherapy, group therapy, did a lot of what was in the 80s kind of things to do in body-oriented therapy, encounter, Gestalt therapy, breathwork, and all this kind of stuff. And I realized that there was a perspective opening up in myself that was different than my social activist identity. And I, being a philosopher, I tried to read about it, and there was a lot of spiritual literature. And to be honest, I hated the spiritual literature because it was often beautiful but I felt that people don't really think. I had the arrogance, at least, of a philosopher that the people didn't really think. And then in the 80s, I found something, or someone, that really was for me an important life change experience. That was the early Ken Wilber. And the early Ken Wilber - in the 1980s, at least in Vienna, nobody knew Ken Wilber - was able to think about social historic realities from a deep consciousness perspective. And I, at the end of my studies, wanted to write my thesis about social change, the evolution of culture, from a deep consciousness perspective, and I wrote about this with a lot of what at that time the early Ken Wilber brought to the table, which was already evolution of consciousness and deep philosophical understanding of a deep dimension of reality that I drew from Martin Heidegger, his whole relationship between being and beings. And this kind of interest and in-depth understanding of who we are, the subject-object divide, led me into being involved in more spiritual work. And, in a spiritual community that I was involved in, mainly in the 90s, there was a work where we very much were looking into what does it mean to come together in a different way in a dialogical form. And this work was the starting work of our dialogue forms that we did. This community broke apart, there's a lot of things I could tell about that, but if you want to have a starting point, this kind of long story is kind of a starting point of how all this work started in my life.\n\nRufus Pollock 05:41\n\nWow. So a couple of things. So I'm always very interested, what was the context that had people in that very beginning inquiry? So just one short question first, about that fascinating odyssey, what was it that had you see in the activism work that there was something missing personally, for you? You know, was there any specific incident? Where did this feeling come from? Because I would guess that many other people you were involved with didn't go on that journey, through therapy or through this kind of spiritual inquiry. So I'm just intrigued, because that's even still very relevant to today, in many ways, that thing, although maybe the political situation and so on has evolved a lot. So for you personally, what was it?\n\nThomas Steininger 06:35\n\nIt's an interesting question. I could point to many things, but maybe, to pick one that was central for me, because our engagement at that time, our typical interest in the 1970s, 1980s, was very much anti-establishment power, against power structures, capitalism, old-fashioned power, but the way we acted between ourselves in all these student groups and university was very power-driven. There, the power dynamics were so much part of ourselves, that there was a huge contradiction between our understanding of having the longing for liberation and equality and people coming together, and the deep investment in just usual power struggles, equal investments and the power game, as you see it everywhere. And this conflict between our big ideals and the reality of how we lived between each other, and myself included by the way, was something that was bothering me. And there was a deep sense that something was missing. And on the other hand, that was part of what my dissertation was about, it was our understanding in this liberation movement about human alienation at that time, it was very much that alienation had to do with the production process with our capitalist societies, and all of that. And it felt for me that our being alienated from reality, from nature, from each other must go deeper than that; that's not the core of it. And in particular, more or less materialistic approach to this seems to be lacking a lot. And that's where the psychotherapy processes opened up for me and brought very deep experiences that also didn't fit to my kind of more down-to-earth naturalistic understanding of reality, so I had to deal with experiences with myself, and integrate them in my own understanding.\n\nRufus Pollock 08:50\n\nSo I just want to highlight that... maybe just as I think, for myself... to summarise it, one point was that in the very movements that were often yearning for liberation, for kind of solidarity, for a kind of form of participation without oppression, without domination... You know, I think what we mean by power structures, often, in that terminology, is kind of domination structures, you know, that's the power stance of that maybe. And this contradiction that you were seeing between the aspirations of the movement then the way that people were behaving, including yourself if you like, inside it. And the point that I think is most interesting is at the end, though, just there, you had this very insightful point, which is that while some people would have been, at that time, like, 'well, we're like this because, you know, we've been brought up inside a capitalist system and we've been sort of formed and we're just kind of reproducing these structures of oppression that have been imprinted on us. While there may be truth in that you also saw that some of this alienation from ourselves, from nature, from each other, went deeper, I would say ontologically, it was like an ontological aspect, more than just a structuralist aspect of it, that it went into our being or nature of our being, which, of course, is formed in society. I just want to flag that maybe we can come back to it or we can explore now, this question is really profoundly ongoingly relevant to all transformative projects, especially obviously, transformative political projects. And, you know, if we just talk that through for our audience, is that crudely I would say one story about the world is like, 'hey, we're going to transform things technologically, even our own being, we're going to invent pills, we're going to take a pill for that, you know, we're going to be a brave new world where you take this or you take out or you go to a movie that stimulates this or that, but we're going to, we're going to transform even our own being and our own well being almost technologically'. And another one, which is the traditional you might say Marxist or just generally, is like, 'okay, there's structures, we don't own the means of production, or, you know, we live in oppressive family structures that reincorporate the domination with the father over everyone else, or whatever. And if we break those structures, or transform those structures, if we create shared ownership of the means of production, or we reorder the nuclear family into a much better one, this alienation and this suffering in ourselves will kind of be transformed. And then finally, there's what I would call and we could discuss together, I don't know how you would call it, I'd be very interested, but an ontological emphasis, which is say, 'yes, those other aspects are, of course, relevant - technological and structural - but really, the fault, or the pathway, lies in ourselves. There's something deep in our human psychology that is transformable. There are practices, there are methods, but really there are deep things in humans that lead us to be alienated or to have suffering. And that remains, obviously, a really relevant question and distinction for ongoing projects of political or social transformation or personal transformation. I've kind of set that out, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Is that what you were alluding to? Or in your way, how would you put it? And how does that relate to what you see still today, or even then, in your evolution?\n\nThomas Steininger 12:47\n\nI mean, it has a lot to do with identity, with who do we identify being, in that sense. And even in this time that we are talking about now, in the 1980s, I had a very powerful experience that made a big difference that maybe speaks to that. In effect it was a spiritual seminar, it was called Enlightenment Intensive. And it's a very simple setting. It was a week and we were sitting in a couple of circles, and you were only doing one thing: you were with a partner, always changing, and one partner asks you one question ongoingly, \"who are you?\" And then you have five minutes to answer. And then it changes. So basically, the whole week, you just go with this one question, who are you? Who are you? And it really becomes interesting when you slowly run out of answers. When you have said everything who you are - a man, Austrian, da da da, activist, da da da - and you have said this already 10 times, something is loosening in your system and things become a little wobbly in that. And there is a point at least that happens for many and happened for me, where you lose deeply a sense of who you think you are. And something is opening up that is you, but you can't name it and it's meaningful. And of course, this is very much related to the meditation experience - big meditation seminars or the meditation tradition I think is very much also around this liberation from identity - and that was something that broke something open in me - not only that but that was part of the process - that still stays with me, where I think, if we use this big word liberation, there is something in our human soul where the capacity to develop an inner freedom from our identification allows us to be here with each other in a very different way. And if you call this 'spiritual justice' there, then this little opening in yourself, or maybe big opening in yourself, seems to be a very profound foundation for a different understanding of who we are as humans, and how we can be together as humans. And, of course, a lot of things changed since this Enlightenment Intensive workshop in Vienna, at the time, but it still speaks to what is important to me.\n\nRufus Pollock 16:01\n\nTo put it in simple words, that kind of liberation, from identity, has a sense of being available at any time or any place. Obviously, you may be different, different environments make it more available, even the very fact there is the Enlightenment Intensive, or do you have the leisure time to go and do it, or we could say various things, but the point is, from what we know of wisdom traditions that kind of liberation has been available in various forms in a whole variety of different cultures, political systems, for thousands of years, so it's kind of really distinct from liberation, maybe in the other more political, sometimes, senses one has. So to move on, so you read Ken Wilber, it had this really big impact, and then, I'd like to talk a little bit more, you said you joined this kind of community in the 90s and that there were certain things that broke down. I'd love to know a bit more about that, both its impact on you, but what were some of the things you learned, or what were the lessons, or what did you see out of that? And maybe you could say a bit more about that.\n\nThomas Steininger 17:20\n\nThe community that I joined, the name changed sometimes, but the name people still know is EnlightenNext. It was around the spiritual teacher Andrew Cohen. And one thing that I still appreciate, and what our work in the core was very much about, was that liberation, also spiritual liberation, it's more important what happens between us than just what happens in me. The work we were doing, and that's still very much related to the work that I'm doing now, was very much finding a way to talk with each other, where, using your word that you just brought it, where we are just available. Something, let's call it, the potential of the moment, is opening up because nobody puts him or herself in the way with identification - we don't have to call it ego identification, it's basically the same thing in my understanding - where one can be so there for this moment, that we can be so there for this moment, that this moment has a chance to show up between us with the potential that it does not have if everyone is clinging on to 'I have to be here', 'you have to be here' and 'my agenda has to come through', 'your agenda has to come through'. But all this doesn't have to completely disappear, one can be there, in fact we have to talk about how it's important also for the individual to be here, but for the individual to be here in a way that one is free from one's identification with one's separate individuality \\[and that\\] allows a different dimension to open up. And we did a lot of our work about it. One thing that was one of our major moments, it had a year-long grow log, but then some of us, something like 30 of us, at this time we were living at the East Coast, Massachusetts in  the countryside, we were for a period of more than three months, only meditating, nothing but meditating, and coming in this kind of dialogues. So we did nothing, but, I don't know how many hours, eight hours, ten hours meditation per day, for months, and every day we would come together in this kind of what we at that time called enlightened communication, and the goal was to be there without being locked into your ego, let's put it that way. And however you want to see that or analyse that, there are many things one can say about that, there was in particular one moment which was just very powerful, something was really breaking open that still is important to me, although a lot of things broke apart since then and we were not ego-free, liberated people all after that, but there was something liberating that was very meaningful and showed the different possibility of humans being together that was part of this work in this EnlightenNext community. That was also one of the pillars of my life that really still is there and important for me.\n\nRufus Pollock 21:23\n\nWow. And, I mean, it's so difficult to talk about these kinds of things powerfully and without... not being it. But just to ask you, so when you say something was breaking open, or there was this experience, so first of all, maybe even to backtrack, how do we normally dialogue or speak? You know, maybe if we're contrasting, maybe we all have experience, but maybe you could just give a concrete vivid illustration of what does it normally look like, and maybe it can be from one's own life, but what's this in contrast with? What's the kind of dialogue or the way that we encounter each other normally? \n\nThomas Steininger 22:28\n\nWhat I would highlight here is that usually when we normally dialogue, that's already a high achievement to dialogue and not to debate, to just make the distinction.\n\nRufus Pollock 22:42\n\nOkay, so tell me what's debating?\n\nThomas Steininger 22:47\n\nThe distinction between debating and dialoguing, one could say, debating is very much where I want to convince you of my way of seeing reality, and you want to do the same from the other way and then either one wins, or we find a compromise, or we find some synergy, but it's basically a battle of perspectives. Debating is a form of battle of perspectives and either with power or with convincing arguments, I can convince you or I can silence you, and then someone wins the debate. Debate is something that someone is winning; a dialogue is not something someone is winning.\n\nRufus Pollock 23:25\n\nLet's pick a toy example that we could think of that would be relevant today that people might debate about, talking about it right now gives a kind of chewiness to it for people listening. It could be about, I don't know, the war in the Ukraine, or it could be about something vivid, like, I don't know, Donald Trump or, you know, President Biden, or something. Can you just give me one example where you and I were debating right now about something?\n\nThomas Steininger 23:57\n\nIt could be the war in Ukraine, it could be, as we were talking about, the sense and nonsense of Web3. It could be also who is washing the dishes today?\n\nRufus Pollock 24:18\n\nYeah. So let's pick Ukraine, maybe, just for example, what would the debate look like? Like what would one of us say like, or maybe I don't know, on the Web3 one, it might be even like, 'okay, Web3 is amazing', or 'Web3 is useless', but what would it look like?\n\nThomas Steininger 24:38\n\nThe main ingredients that makes a debate a debate is that I know what is true and I want to find ways to put this truth on you, either that you agree, or at least that you are not able to counter my argument, that I'm able to silence you. So the way when I talk about the war in Ukraine, I know what it is and I hear you disagree, and I hear your arguments, and then I'm looking for the weak spots of your argument so that I can make clear why you're wrong, and why I'm right. But the foundation is that I'm very based in my conviction of knowing and that the whole orientation of the debate is to expand my knowing to other people, so that they become part of my knowing in that. And of course, it can get more complicated, you also can convince me, but basically, underneath is this foundation of identity and knowing that is fixed and that tries to win. And that, I would say, is the basic characteristics of what the debate is about. Which also can be powerful. It's like a powerful chess game.\n\nRufus Pollock 26:17\n\nSo let's take an example that maybe, even at least for our average listeners, so imagine I'm quite convinced that Russia is wrong, Vladimir Putin is wrong, they shouldn't be invading Ukraine. If I were coming from, like, 'I know that', this is not meaning I can't have a conviction in a view, but it's like, 'I know I'm right'. Or it could be vice versa, I'm like, 'I think Putin is great and I think Russia have got right on their side', that would become a debate with this clash of opinion about it. And what would then a dialogue start to look like? And then we're going come to a kind of emerging dialogue, or, I don't know, enlightened dialogue. What even would dialogue look like between you and me? Let's say, I'm pro Russia at the moment, you're pro Ukraine. What would it look like?\n\nThomas Steininger 27:21\n\nIt's cool to ask this question. The main difference is, I would say, is that in debate I'm listening for something different than I would listen for in a dialogue. In a debate, because I'm convinced of whatever, I listen for where you object and where the weak points of your objections are. It's a whole usual thought process of warfare, I look for your weak spots so that I can come through with my arguments. When I listen to what you're saying, basically, I'm looking so 'ah, he's saying that and that, and that's a weak argument. I go in there.'\n\nRufus Pollock 28:10\n\nYeah. Yeah. So let's say in here, it's like, you say something about Ukraine, and I'd be looking just like, 'well, that's wrong, because of this, you know, look the US are supplying, and you'd be like, 'no, look, at the Russians', right. And in a dialogue, what are we looking for? What are we listening for then?\n\nThomas Steininger 28:32\n\nThe main thing, I would say, or the starting point is that I really try to understand you, even if you're thinking the opposite, that you're thinking that really Putin is right and it's all about NATO east expansion, and Russia is cornered and they have to defend their security interests and basically it was the NATO who started this war already in the 1990s when they promised to... you can make all the arguments. In dialogue you listen differently when you try to understand the other, even if you disagree, to understand where does he or she come from? What's this world about? And in the difference that is occurring, there is still place for argument where I think 'da da da doesn't make sense', I bring it, but the foundation is listening for mutual understanding. Now, here you are as the other with this other perspective which I really don't understand and maybe really annoys me, or triggers me in whatever way, but I'm curious enough to try to create something where there's mutual understanding, some bridge-building possible between one and the other, not kind of in the flatlining, I don't care, still holding my ground. Not kind of just being 'I don't care'; I care not only about you, I also care about myself and holding this tension, this friction, that can be very uncomfortable, because it's a place where I really don't agree with you, but to still want to listen with you.\n\nRufus Pollock 30:57\n\nYes.\n\nThomas Steininger 31:00\n\nAnd then there is something, I make a little leap here, but I think it's interesting because we've worked with this very example quite often and it illustrates something: when I listen to you, how vulnerable can I be in this listening? A good thought experiment is, if you say something that really would pull the carpet from underneath my feet, would be very disturbing, not that I have to agree with you, but if that is the case, do I really want to hear you? Or do I make a choice that there's some things I don't want to hear, because I don't want to be shaken up where I stand. And I'm not even saying that it is important to let the rug be pulled, I'm not saying that, but just as a thought experiment to see there's a point where I'm not sure, at least that's the way I always go to this, I'm not sure I really want to hear you because holding my ground is essentially more important than hearing you and to be aware that this is the point where I stopped talking with you. Just to be aware that it takes a lot of courage to make this spot more open that even if what you have to say to me is really maybe destroying my whole world just because something is coming in that I have not thought about or whatever, do I have the courage to hear your or do I basically shut down because I want to be not irritated in my security of my self identity. And you see this is quite often the end of a conversation, although we can continue talking, but basically, there is a wall and I close my ear when you bring this up and find a way around it and 'this is waterproof' kind of thing, because I don't want to be touched. And just to be aware of this shows how dialogue can really be something open, how dialogue can be really dangerous, how it also needs an atmosphere of trust, because to do this with someone who is not trustworthy is maybe a stupid thing to do.\n\nRufus Pollock 33:37\n\nYeah.\n\nThomas Steininger 33:38\n\nBut if there's a trustworthy relationship, a lot that is transformative, profoundly transformative, can happen in any conversation. And \\[especially\\] when there's so much trust that basically I don't stop listening.\n\nRufus Pollock 33:58\n\nCan I ask then, to make it concrete, if you could share even, let's say, in the EnlightenNext community, and in these moments where you were really doing this profoundly, what kind of things would you dialogue about? Can you give a concrete example from your own past experience that really opened something up for you that you were dialoguing about? And it might have been a very simple topic, but that kind of makes it concrete for me or the listeners, something that could really be that powerful. I mean, I can imagine but I would just like to hear.\n\nThomas Steininger 34:33\n\nI mean, what comes to my mind, and that was part of the spiritual work, we talked a lot about our ego-structures, my male arrogance, or, for example, about my German identification, German identity, in relationship to a lot of denial of what happened in the Second World War and a lot of justification, and a lot of 'da da da' where I just feel very comfortable because being Austrian slash German - to make this not differentiated for the sake of the conversation - a lot of things that in my environment are just a shared given, how Austrians see themselves as they were victims of history and not perpetrators in that sense, and how we translate it in the generation after the war, and how we find justification stories, and to see, in that sense, our cultural identity being built around certain myths and certain blind spots, that if somebody else shares that you very easily touch a pain point where you're not sure you want to go there. And that same thing's true for any history, any identity, talking about American identity and American race history, Native Americans' extinction, whatever. And it doesn't have to be histories, it's also my personal relationship with maybe you or maybe my partner there, my male superiority is just playing out in a way and because I may be able to play some intellectual game, I can hold power in this way and I don't want to let go, and I don't want to see it, and people just saying, 'hey, look', and maybe you don't want to look, because you don't want to see yourself because it shatters a little bit your ideal self-perception; things show up that you don't want, shadow work.\n\nRufus Pollock 35:44\n\nSo in the eight or ten hours you would do this meditation, what then? Would there be a group dialogue? Or would it be you dialogue with someone else, and they would bring up these things potentially?\n\nThomas Steininger 37:42\n\nThis kind of dialogues that I was just describing we did over many years ongoingly together. And there are also danger points with that because you can create group dynamics and group perspectives, cultish forms of dialogue structures of that, which was also part of what happened with us. So there are also shadow points and blind spots in this. But in, in this particular face that you're pointing to, around this, it was more about the capacity to allow something between us to emerge that is shared and something that we are together in, but standing also on our autonomy, it's not kind of a group thing, but it has its own wholeness where a dialogical field can be also rooted in something very deep, which is kind of connected to what I just shared before about this Enlightment Intensive experience, where it's not about me, Thomas, but something, the life itself, shows up between us like that, and to have conversations where we find a way to this relational fields to be self-aware, let's put it that way.\n\nRufus Pollock 39:40\n\nAnd what kind of topics were you talking about in the group? Can it be anything? Were there particular things?\n\nThomas Steininger 39:55\n\nI have a hard time to remember exactly what we were talking about at that time. On one hand it was very personal, on the other hand, it was very atmospheric. But that was also very specific about this particular work that we did at that point so I wouldn't make this too general a point because that was related to that particular work we tried to do at this time in this context. And in the end, it is not important. Yes. In the end, what I think is important is what you have pointed out to be available for whatever, and what I mean by being available for whatever is what is relevant in this situation that I'm here right now. \n\nRufus Pollock 40:49\n\nI suppose why I'm also speaking to it is it can sound to some people a little bit, I would say, almost magical, like there's this wholeness or this field. So before I got this very concreteness of it, which I can see, which is there are things that you could say to me that like, 'can I be with them?' You know, that I can really see that, and that there's something in my ego, there is something that is opening up a spaciousness in myself, where maybe a disidentification with those things. I mean, I want to say for myself is the things we've done that aren't so nice, I always sometimes have said that, you know, I think the hardest thing is to have been, if I were a rapist, to really be able to be with that. Not to make it okay or anything like that, but we always have such self-image of how we were good, or, you know, the ideal of ourselves, and to be able to somehow hold that and not 'oh, it doesn't matter', but somehow stepping back from it creates this space around so many things, because we so identify with our positions, including our positions about who we are like, whatever they might be, you know, like, I'm smart, I'm good, or that I'm not good, or whatever those are and so I really see that. And then you were saying there's sort of this field that emerges, as you said, that it's something in the dialogue in the space which is more than the sum of its parts yet it isn't a dissolution that we sometimes have crudely, like, I'm going to dissolve into some kind of like, you know, group, it's somehow more than but yet respect to the individuation, but it's just, I'm only coming back to it \\[because\\], why I'm asking is for the concreteness of it is, I get that it's not important but it just makes it real, potentially, for people who may or may not have experienced such a phenomenon? \n\nThomas Steininger 43:22\n\nI'm not sure if the concrete content makes it more real. And let me talk about the magic that you brought up. I would say it is magic. But what I mean with that is, or to explain myself, I think that individuation is also magic. One very down-t- earth understanding of magic is what we create with language. I find it magic when I use a word, like the word tree, and I'm pretty sure that in your consciousness somehow something like treeness shows up. That's the foundational form of magic, to be able to manifest something to language. And since we started to use language in human history, we also started magic. Magic and the start of language happened pretty much at the same time in that sense. And the fact that we were able as a species - to step back a little bit and take a meta perspective here which I think explains something - that we were able to basically leave our embeddedness in the natural process that we were in and shared with all other natural species, that we were able first to form identities as a tribe, this particular cultural forms, and it was all done with language into, starting with different forms of storytelling, coming in the hero story, all of a sudden there was the creation of the individual that stands out of the indigenous tribe, it has its own onus and the basic story form of the hero is the one who stands against the embeddedness, embeddedness with nature, embeddedness with the gods and goddesses and finds his onus. With Odysseus, or Ulysses, Homer did an amazing piece basically showing our Western, Greek, European individuation process. How Ulysses basically is able to fool the gods with the forces around him to basically enforce his own individuation, his own heroic existence, in that. That is a form of magic that he created and that created our whole culture, at least our European, Modernist culture, it's based on a certain perspective that we hold with this language, it's based on the separation that we kind of manifest, that I am myself and I'm related to objects and even other people I can objectify and can have instrumental relation \\[with\\], it's a whole world that we are creating through a cultural magical game, that even science in this form creates this magic, as a scientific language. That creates a certain awareness of reality that's based on subject-object relationship, subjectivity, instrumentality to create this world that we created as a species, as a culture. And maybe we are at a turning point right now where this game comes to its own end. There in the hyper individuation process, and the whole epidemics of narcissism, the shadow sides of this game are showing so strongly that there is an evolutionary drive to find new forms of free integration in wholeness. This experience that I was describing of a relational field, is maybe an attempt to not lose individuality, but to create an awareness that even individuality is embedded always in relationship, and to have a psychological, emotional, spiritual relationship to this embeddedness and then you give it the word field to express this. But of course, it's not a physical field or whatever, you use a word to express something that somehow has a relationship to a certain experience, that has some resonance with the experience. And that, I think, is something that is happening right now, in many places, not only in the spiritual community that we were in, but in many places, that it seems that our hyper individual, postmodern world is looking for forms of free integration. Thich Nhat Hanh's interbeing, reinterpreting Buddhism with this interbeing language, goes, from my interpretation, in the same direction in some way other people do similar work in that. So there seems to be something in the air, where the evolution of culture and consciousness is seeking, magically, to find new language games, to talk with Wittgenstein, that allows us to experience and communicate our embeddedness. And that's how I would interpret this experience. Sorry, it was a long answer, and a little philosophical one.\n\nRufus Pollock 45:53\n\nYes, let's talk about the magic.  It's great. So I want to come back to that, let's work that through for myself and maybe for listeners, and I think maybe also to expand on it in examples of what we mean by these terms like individuation and then integration. So I maybe want to bring another example that we're all familiar with, well which we all went through whether we remember it, but we might know if we've seen babies. So as a tiny child, when a child is born, from what we know and obviously, we can't really interview very young children, but we can do kind of experiments to understand how they see the world. They may not really see themselves as separate from the world, like they kind of are the world that they're in and a really tiny one-week- or a few-month-old baby is their sensations and doesn't have a sense of their body separate from the environment and things like that. And there's a sense, I'm picking an analogy, but you were also using it in the grand historical perspective, which I want to come back to, but there's a sense of individuation in a child as they start to see themselves as separate, like, there's some kind of distinction of them. And that's a very natural, and even healthy, phenomenon. And what you're also talking about, I'm just kind of trying to get that for people to understand individuation, there's a sense of, at one point the child is totally embedded in their environment, in a sense. Similarly, while again we can't go back in a time machine and go back 50,000 years or 100,000 years or even 10,000 years and really understand, or interview Homo Sapiens and understand how they see the world. There is a sense in a historical perspective, from the literature we have, from what we do know, and even from societies we know today, like indigenous, that there wasn't the sense of the individual distinct from who they were interwoven with the group. And what we're talking to here is that there's been, there's a suggestion, that there's been a big historical process, which is both a victory and, as we just discussed, has many shadows, of individuation, what that means, just like the child stops being just 'I am one with the environment', in an actually healthy way, they see 'ah I've got a boundary of my body', that there are objects in another sense. For example, very, very young children, if you do experiments, don't really, if an object disappears, for them, it's just gone out of existence, they don't search for it, it's gone, if I hide something behind the chair. And at some point the child realises there are objects out there, as it were, \"in the world\" that can disappear and that they can search for, they can recover, that are separate from them. I'm giving the very concrete examples from developmental literature. But this sense of individuation goes on. And, first of all, just if there's anything you want to say, to do better than me in kind of setting that up, and then there's a sense of which that has extended, that's become, we'll come to I think in a moment, this era we're in that has become so exaggerated or taken to such extremes, that the shadows of it have become very apparent, though we should acknowledge the great victory. But first, was there anything you want to say just to kind of spell out individuation. And I think this is really profound, again, it comes back to the ontological theme, but also really talks actually deeply, if people are listening, to think to how this relates to some of the predicaments, like concrete things like we talked about, like narcissism, but also what's going on with our political systems or our challenges of dealing with global crises like the ecological crisis, the climate crisis. I also want to end, I'm just flagging this for people, I want to come back to, one modern reaction, say, 'Oh, we want to go back'. We want to go back to the wisdom of indigenous cultures, which have huge amounts of wisdom, but in some of the story here is it's not one wants to go back, it's like the pendulum will swing, but it doesn't swing back, the pendulum is moving upwards, we're tracing, if you like, a helix upwards, so I want to come to all of those things. But I just want to start with the individuation point just to explain that for people, because it's a kind of a technical term and I know it relates to Jung and other things. What do we mean by individuation?\n\nThomas Steininger 54:02\n\nThank you for that. And this is a moment where I really regret that Elizabeth, my partner is not here because she is a developmental psychologist and really has a lot to say to that. But what you're describing, I think is also common knowledge. We know that and of course, people like Piaget really... that's what their work is about, to describe these changes that you are describing. And one thing that all of us know besides the examples that you just brought is when a child I think at the age of around three starts to change language and not talks anymore about oneself in the third person but the first person and just to see what it takes in consciousness to... or what it means to talk about yourself in the third person is kind of a loose way that the identification process reaches a different firmness when you don't talk about him, but I talk about me. And then this meanness really starts. And this is also, as far as I know, where the first really rebellious phase in life happens, where you really start to try the boundaries of your parents. Because you encounter the choice of saying no, basically, 'Oh, no, no, no' and screaming because you want something... all the willfulness... you you're starting to experiment and play with your own willfulness in a way where we discover something that is our essence. And I really think what you are pointing out that often because we are aware that narcissism is such a theme of our time, and our disconnectedness is such a theme that we all suffer from, and the whole wave of indigenous renaissance that we are living through right now, expresses also that we realise that those cultures who have not gone through the same process of modality that we have gone through hold some forms of wisdom that we have lost. But there is a very simple example again, that I think highlights what you were pointing to. Because when we were not separate, yet, in our indigenous tribe, there was a real power and united togetherness. Also, by the way, togetherness with nature \\[is included\\] in this, we have not objectified each other and all of that and and that's partly \\[what\\] our romantic sense is responding to: 'wow, this is beautiful, this is powerful'. And this is true. But there's another element that's worth looking at: that this was not a choice. This was a given. Nobody could step out of the tribe, there was no freedom to step out of the tribe. Literally... there are enough examples to demonstrate that people, indigenous, being taken out of the tribe die. And not because they starve or something like that, maybe that too. But psychologically, you just cannot take that you don't exist outside. So to see that this is powerful, but there's also a necessity built in and a lack of freedom to do anything else but that. That is a very different situation than we are in, that we can say no, I'm not part of the society. I'm not part of this culture. I'm not part of this family. And I really can do my thing. And it can be very narcissistic. But we also can make a choice to come together. But this togetherness is different, fundamentally different because it's based on our choosing capacity to do so. To to be aware that this kind of togetherness is based on the freedom to choose, that's very different than the factuality of just being together. It shows that this is not a going back to some romantic idea, but what I would call here trans-individuation, the rediscovery of our embeddedness in our togetherness, \\[which\\] is always based on our capacity of free choice, and also the responsibility to choose the right form of togetherness, because you can also choose the Nazi form of togetherness, and that's maybe something one can discuss if it's the right thing of coming together. So our form of responsibility of individuation and only with individuation as you will responsibility, for someone who is re-sponsible, forms a different way of this related, this field of relationship that's different than the indigenous one can learn a lot. But we also have to learn a lot from our process of individuation. \n\nRufus Pollock 59:34\n\nYes, I think that's really important exactly to acknowledge and I think this is, again, to actually come back always to the political point, if I can bring it up here, is the traumas of individuation, which may go back much further than certainly even in modern times, you know, that people think of, whether it's the Nazi rallies or it's the Inquisition... this incredible victory meme that dominates, for example, if you go just read political theory most of it's about how do people have freedom to kind of do what they want, you know, in the sense of play whatever music or read whatever books... this is just incredible victory. That shows up-- I'm giving formal examples in our kind of governmental... but the kind of underlying ontological achievement that represents is, what you're saying is kind of massive, and almost not acknowledged and particularly in these moments because it is now gone, its shadows have arrived. And so just to acknowledge that, the great victory of that freedom, and it shows up even in victory today, which is, you know, many, many societies are and were patriarchal, you know, the victories of individuation are still being reaped, whether I think they relate, you know, many of these areas, to see people, as sovereign individuals with their own rights, and all these kinds of things. And the trauma, though, that we are still dealing with of that victory, and, well not that vic-, but also, you know, of dealing with the group and oppressions by the group, and so on. And what you're now coming to is to say, but we also see the great limitations of what we could call hyper individuation, you mentioned narcissism, but an atomized society, you know, the things we can say are kind of classic: loneliness, but also, our great, our lack of embeddedness, or connection, with nature in a visceral sense. The other thing that I want to reiterate in all of this is that we have to necessarily on a call like this, we can't really do practice, although I and Thomas can be kind of, I hope, practising a bit the concreteness of this. The visceralness of these things, in both directions. And so when we say, 'Oh, we're not embedded in nature,' I mean, in a way, I could have no idea of what it really means, although I grew up in the country, \\[I could have no idea of\\] what it really means to be connected, fully connected with nature, in a certain way, but that this is something that really is showing up today in the way that we act, the way that we behave, the way that we are, the way we operate. And I wonder, therefore, coming to one of the things that you're really looking at is ways that we're not necessarily going back because we can't, we don't, we cannot go back. In a sense, it's not the same thing. What is the going forward? So then that does come back -- this is what you've been describing even earlier in these experiences in these practices. And again, this magic, you said, is we're looking for ways really to integrate the victories of individuation, of our autonomy, of our individuality... back, though, into something that is a collective but that isn't a reversal \\[...\\], it's something really where that autonomy and responsibility and sovereignty or something is preserved, yet there is something new that emerges and there is a sense of being the collective and connectedness and so on. Is that what the, that's what the work that you...?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:04:03\n\nAbsolutely. To emphasise what you're pointing to, that is also what Ken Wilber calls the dignity of modernity, that we right now tend to forget, because we are so much in the drama of modernity right now. So, rightfully, we also have to emphasise how we move beyond that and also beyond the postmodern revolt against that, to integrate it on a higher level, but it has to be honoured, the dignity. It has to be seen, has to be in there. Otherwise, we end up with all kinds of regressions. So, this is a critical point to make. And what this really means ongoingly has to be found out on a theoretical level but also on the practical level. And to talk more from a practical level, I think that's at least what our Emergent Dialogue practice is focusing on that is developed out of that what we did in the 90s. And what we did afterwards in our work here a little bit peopled by Partner and others. Here, we are working this now, since, I think, it goes to 30 years now. And one simple way to understand what an anchor point can be to enter this different form of being together here is what I would call synergetic intuition. It sounds a little bit like a mouthful and a fancy word and I'll try to explain what I mean. But when we are, in whatever situation with whatever factors, let's have people and beyond people, there is a multitude that comes together and builds a situation. Let's say we are in a dialogue, and there are 10 people. And let's leave all the other factors out right now. Let's just focus on these 10 people, different perspectives, different life stories, different agendas, different drama points, different hopes. And there's a conversation that has a certain reason why we are here. And there is a multitude, and how does this multitude find a wholeness? How do we not stay fragmented or fragment so that I have no clue... The worst thing is that we fight each other, but also just to be next to each other and have no real relationship is a form of fragmentation. That we as the circle of 10 people say \\[...\\] we just don't find the wholeness, a meaningful wholeness, that everyone knows when the conversation comes to its own and somehow it feels very meaningful, what we're talking about, and we're all in it, and something's happening. And it's beyond my agenda or your agenda. It's happening. There's some meaningful wholeness building, because we did something right, let's put it that way, or something right happened, however. And I think one word to understand this rightness is the beautiful word synergy. That 'synergy' means that different points, factors, identities, all look for how they can form a meaningful whole. And it makes a huge difference in any situation, when I'm interested, have a sense organ for this synergetic capacity of a situation, and I'm in support of it to show up or not. And when enough people in a room have a focus and the capacity to really \\[...\\] support this, synergy happens in a much more profound way, in a much more powerful way. And the potential between us gets multiplied just because we don't focus fragmentation. We focus on synergy and synergy does not mean that we fall into one. And there is no difference anymore. It is a creative relationship of difference, even greater friction, where I don't agree with you but there's something very powerful in this disagreement that's really interesting. We don't even have to agree in the end. But still, it was very enriching to have this conversation with you. If you agree or disagree, maybe both \\[are\\] a good outcome, but something synergized in this and the capacity to be there for this synergetic field is, I think, a way to understand what this form of being together holds in a way that I'm not primarily interested in me and my agenda and you and your agenda and debate or whatever. But we are together. We are here together for something that is a creative wholeness, that we still have to find out what it is.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:09:30\n\nAnd again, so if you, if I were thinking for myself, or listeners to think for themselves, it would be interesting to say let's just pick something simple. Your partner and you \\[for example\\], I don't know, there's some debate over what one's going to do this week, you know, whether we're going to go to the cinema or whether we're going to go to the theatre, or let's say something more profound, I'm just kind of wondering... so like for you, or even could you give an example of like when you've seen this happen, where you've seen a group having to decide on a topic, and it could be a present topic, or it could be something, a really big discussion about the Ukraine war, and what you've seen happen when it does go into this versus not -- just describe that? Yeah, I'm just trying to...\n\nThomas Steininger 1:10:27\n\nLet me give a very concrete example out of my life that just happened a couple of weeks ago. And yeah, that I found significant. We do in our work, every summer, a retreat. And we did it in the last years in Italy, in Assisi. This year, we wanted to go out of some reasons to a powerful place in Turkey. And then the war happened. And it just did not feel right. To go to a retreat in Turkey, it kind of felt like some escapist thing... So a couple of us came together and just were expressing this, feeling uncomfortable with this. And out of this conversation came the idea, why don't we go to Berlin? Berlin is a city that holds so much. It's a symbol, the reality of division in our time, and also the creative response to division. So there's something very powerful in the place of that, and that just happened out of this conversation, then we had no idea how we were to do this. And we had some friends in Berlin, we started to talk. And to cut a long story short, we came up with some friends in a very powerful co-working, co-living space, and another friend who runs a community, in Berlin with young people, they call themself the Church of Interbeing... and they, we, we said, let's do this together. And then we had a process where we just are in many Zoom calls. And then in a couple of days in Berlin, we just went from our places and talked: how do we do this retreat together? And everybody has their places. And somehow it felt \\[as though\\] nobody really designed this retreat. It was a conversation, where things fell into place. It was even not only a conversation between people, we also we went to different places and felt that the place told us something, how to do this. And this listening to this ongoing synergetic presence between us, the places and the idea, allowed in a very short time that a retreat unfolded and in the end was, at least from my sense, very powerful and very successful. But it really happened in its own emergence and listening to the unknown between us: how does this potential want to arrive here? And it was not someone having an agenda, let's do this. And it was really ongoingly being very open and in the unknown, and seeing, 'Oh, wow, this fits together, well, this fits-- no, this doesn't fit together'. Now, all of a sudden, it's a synergetic whole building, that in the end, I am just very happy how it happened. So that's was for me really an expression of a synergetic coming together, where none of us there over-invested and also there was no ego involved. But we were not overly invested in our ego, so that something powerful \\[could\\] emerge between us that was beyond ourselves and \\[that\\] in the end, I think, was really in service of the situation, the people involved and everything else.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:14:09\n\nAnd also, do you have a converse example of something you've ever experienced? Where you didn't feel that dialogue? Or for some reason there was a block -- and what happened then? Like, have you ever done an event where that wasn't somehow in place and therefore things... you felt that discussion happen... I'm just trying to work out how people can feel that when they have it...\n\nThomas Steininger 1:14:31\n\nYeah, I do... what comes to my mind right now is a group of people that I'm involved in since some years where we are also again from different backgrounds, or worked together, how to create a more conscious culture in Germany. And to cut it short, COVID ripped us apart. The investments in different forms \\[of\\] how to respond to COVID, to be with the establishment response or with the more alternative, even conspiracy, response are... although we are very conscious people, we were not able to hold it. We fragmented, and not to give any one of us now... we fragmented... we were not able to hold this difference in a creative, co-creative, synergetic way. I'm \\[...\\] still looking for what can happen in the future, but for the moment we failed.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:15:56\n\nSo, yeah, I mean, this is what I want to bring up, it's something that I think is really subtle, which, just for example, a friend was talking about recently. Which was put in a simple way, there was an event he was participating in. And he's also from a research background. You know, he was in academia, and the thing he really respected in academia was \\[...\\] particularly in research collaborations-- So his interest was when when you saw groups operating, like good research groups, because in academia, you can be in departments. And there's different reading groups, or different research groups, and some are really kind of not very functional, you know, and some are really productive. \\[...\\] And so that's just the context. And he was in a group and there was a lot of stuff about, like, everyone had to speak equally, and they were like asking a relatively expert question about like, how do you do research to assess, you know, something? And what he was noticing, which is something sometimes that happens today, and I'm asking this in this kind of question of dialogue, which is, you know, there was a kind of a bit of formality, like people felt like, everyone, you know, there's a question of who should speak, you know, who had power... there are these things that come up. But even that there are differences of opinion? I guess, yeah, this question, which is, when you operate with a lot -- I'm not articulating this question super well, so I'm gonna kind of work it through, and we're going to make it a bit what we can... What he was saying, what he saw in research groups was there was a tolerance for inequality of speaking or participation at given moments because someone had expertise. But the group had this core purpose, and that would dance, it wouldn't be someone who always-- In a given moment, it would be like, 'Okay, we got a statistics question. This person knows a lot about statistics.' But you could also have very strong differences of opinion, that would, at least in productive groups, there could be clashes, but it would somehow synergize and you would move on. I guess why I'm trying to bring this up is that what I'm hearing is that also, this isn't about being nice. This kind of practice of something emerging isn't about us all being like, oh, everyone's view is of equal validity. But there's somehow an ability to add, to kind of be with productive tension or creative tension. And in this group that kind of pulled apart-- like, I guess what it is is: what is it that allows the group to not have too much tension or be pulled apart versus...? You know, it sounds like when you did, \\[when\\] you're available, and everyone's kind of committed to the mission, \\[when\\] there's a general alignment, and even maybe cultural alignment, there are going to be differences, but there's enough kind of shared... It's like, in this other group that wasn't so productive, \\[...\\] even though there was maybe the formality, there wasn't a space actually of creative difference. Versus when there is in a research group, which might even be quite... maybe sometimes even egoic, but I'm not sure. In the good research groups that's actually one of the funny things is, even if people have got big egos, the egos in terms of what you're doing is sort of put to the side, you know, you're committed to the scientific mission. And I just kind of-- I know my question is not so clear. But how does one, even in the lowest sense of this, allow not to be pulled apart like you've described, but also not to become like flatland where like, you know, oh, everyone has equal listening to, everyone's view is equally valid, because yes, everyone's view is equal, like we want to listen to everyone in a true sense of listen, but at some point, how do we deal with tensions or conflicts? Like that's, I guess my other question would be: when have you had a group \\[which\\] has had a lot of tension like the COVID group, and has successfully synergized?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:19:43\n\nI have had this experience also. And I think the point is a completely different one. It's not about everyone being equal. It's not even about everyone being heard, although this is a virtue, which I find important. It's even not a shared mission, although I find this is important also, it can help. But they also can be in the way, by the way. What I would emphasise is, again, this mysterious thing called the field, or the wholeness between us. To be aware that there's something alive between us, that's more than the sum of the parts. That has its wholeness. And I find something that really makes a difference here -- at least the way we do this, there may be other ways of how to go about this -- \\[is\\] to create awareness of this dialogical field. Of this energetic field. And not an intellectual awareness, \\[but\\] an experiential awareness: that one really can sense into the aliveness of this, to speak in semi-mythological language, that you can look through the eyes of this energetic space itself, you're not just looking through the Thomas eyes, or Rufus eyes, but I'm able to look through the eyes of the space itself. And what I find very powerful, at least for myself, is to really have a real love relationship with this. So there is something that is very powerful in groups, which I would call interpersonal relationship. So that I'm not just me, and you are an instrumental part of my reality. But I honour you and I honour her and I honour him. And this is a very important foundation of a real relationship in a dialogical field. But this is, I would say, an interpersonal experience, where I'm aware of you and her and him and the network of us in that. But it's not the wholeness itself. The way I would talk about this field consciousness, I would call it this emergent interbeing. It has its own life form to say. I mean, I'm speaking semi-mythologically to make a point here. And to be aware of its needs in that situation, what does this relation field really need from me and from you, and my capacity to hold the relationship with this emergent interbeing field, and our shared capacity to do that allows us to hold the tension between us in a way that we don't fracture and where it's not even, again, the point is not that we, in the end, love everything everyone is saying. It can stay in friction, it can be productive, it can be creative, or we can agree and find something that's... but everything that kind of synergizes in this not kind of 'everything is nice and everything is equal' way, but it can be very complex, difficult, all kinds of stuff. But there's a love for this experienced wholeness of this emergent interbeing field that allows us to anchor us in that and to hold us so that this becomes creative and does not fall apart.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:23:32\n\nAnd can you give a concrete example where this hadn't happened in this time of COVID with this group? Where is the example when you've seen that happen, when there was quite a tense topic. And where there were differences, but it was able to be held in this way. And what the result was. Do you have an example, even from EnlightenNext, you know, \\[...\\] just to kind of get really concrete. Were there tensions in EnlightenNext that got resolved through this kind of dialogue? Or things you've seen in recent times where you've seen this really play out?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:24:12\n\nEnlightenNext is a different story because--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:24:14\n\nThen let's leave that one for the moment, but just any example you could give me concretely if you have a topic that you think you can describe, \\[where for example\\] these people have these quite different views, or I had this different view, \\[...\\] but this was actually the result, like by \\[being\\] able to hold the field like that.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:24:29\n\nI mean, in some way, this is my ongoing experience in doing our magazine, where we have sometimes very different perspectives on--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:24:48\n\nCan you make it, just on this one, just give me a concrete difference and it could be just the simplest thing like we wanted to have this as the lead story or that, but a concrete example where this came up where two people in the magazine had really different perspectives. And then what happened? Like, if you did this interaction and the field was held? This was the resolution?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:25:10\n\nLet me go back to this retreat decision, because we really had in that very different views if, at this point, going to Turkey was something that we should do. Or if it's even a problem to do something, or if there's a need of \\[something\\] different and we had no answer for this for a couple of weeks. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:25:45\n\nAnd so what happened? What would one person say? You don't have to name them, but \\[for example\\] Person X thought that we should go to Turkey strongly and Person Y... you know, like, what actually happened? Like people would get on a call, and they would just...\n\nThomas Steininger 1:26:03\n\nI'm just a little cautious to not talk about too intimate things here. In that sense, even without naming names. But there were different focus points. People who were more focused on creating for people a nice experience somewhere, and people who were more kind of thinking about a more strategic context where this retreat has to, or can, serve a certain function in developing what we're doing, and where the personal experience on the rigidity is important, but it's not the whole context. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:26:03\n\nRight. \n\nThomas Steininger 1:26:06\n\nAnd at the same time, both sides are right somehow. There's a big, you can call it strategic context, how a retreat serves a bigger cause, and it has a certain function and a certain thing that you want to try and bring to the world. And there are certain life experiences that you bring to people who join this that you want to support. And they can be very in contrast to each other, opposing each other.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:27:38\n\nSo it could have been a breakdown, it could have been \\[that\\] these two camps formed and kind of slugged it out, and maybe even whatever resolution would have -- there might have been no resolution -- but even if there had been a resolution, people would have been conquered or dissatisfied, one group would have-- Whereas instead, you're saying there was a group decision that was made relatively efficiently. And \\[...\\] it was an integrative decision that built on this field to find something that people were really whole with.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:28:10\n\nI mean, what we tend to do -- and this is a language that we don't use, but other groups use that and I find it applicable -- is that the decision process is consensus-oriented. And consensus-oriented does not mean that in the end, everyone kind of has the same perspective. But that we are behind what we do in the end together.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:28:42\n\nI mean, Amazon's founder famously has this phrase, 'Disagree and commit'.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:28:49\n\nYes, exactly. But for that, you have to be very aware of a lot of factors to be able to do that. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:28:55\n\nYes. \n\nThomas Steininger 1:28:56\n\nAnd \\[...\\] there has to be a lot of freedom from one's own agenda. Particularly to do what you're describing: to disagree but be behind it. Because, whatever, it seems to be the right thing, although I still disagree. Maybe the reason \\[is\\] because it cannot be decided, and it's more important that we move together here than to fracture. And because of that, although I still see differently, I'm really behind doing this, because -- and then maybe it connects directly again to our work -- I'm aware of this relational field and I don't want to hurt it. So just to make the point clear, it's not that I don't want to hurt each other; that can be part of it. But I don't want to hurt the potential of this field. But this field... what is relevant here right now and the way we can see this together, that only can find itself in not fragmenting. And to hold this together and to value that needs first essential awareness of its reality, that it's not just an abstract idea that I can contemplate, but it's, this is much more existential. Because if I just contemplate it as an idea, that then basically all becomes a head thing. But if I have an existential experience of this wholeness, we are talking on a very different level.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:30:44\n\nI want to encourage anyone listening -- it's, really, this is a practice \\[...\\] -- really, to practise. And I think it talks to things we all know, which is that we spend much of our time not in such productive-- well, in debate or not productive dialogue. I wanted to switch tracks right towards the end here and ask a couple of other questions. So one is: what was EnlightenNext, because I think there is a lot of inspiration for people wanting to cr-- you know, in many ways it sounds like an incredible community. I've heard testimony from other people who've been participating. But it also broke down. What were lessons of that? Or like, what happened? Because I think this is a moment when people have a lot of ideas about, again, we want more transformative communities. What did you take from that experience as something that we could... what was the source of breakdown? What can we learn about, I don't know, whatever you want to speak to there? But yeah, anything there that you'd like to talk to? Because I think it has a lot of lessons for people today.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:31:55\n\nYou have another hour? A couple? I mean, there's a lot we can say. Just maybe one thing why I think that in the end, it fell apart?\n\nRufus Pollock 1:32:11\n\nYeah. \n\nThomas Steininger 1:32:13\n\nI think it fell apart... Again, \\[there are\\] many, many things that one can bring into it; I'll just pick one that I think is very central. There was a built-in contradiction between what was our project, what we tried to do, and the way we did it, because this capacity of interrelated emergence basically needs that this dialogical field really comes into the lead. But we did it in a top-down context of basically a guru context where the power structure was outside of the project. And that would have needed a complete redo of our relations in order for this dialogical field to come to its own. And--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:33:29\n\nSo, just concretely, so for people who are listening, like Andrew Cohen was the guru...\n\nThomas Steininger 1:33:35\n\nWhy did that not happen? Andrew Cohen was the guru and basically, it was a top-down power structure where this dialogical field that we are talking about was... somehow this was what we were interested in, and also what Andrew was interested in in some way. But to do that, to basically let go of this guru position would have been a necessity for this dialogical field to come to dawn. And that did not happen. Again, I could say more about it, but... simply because Andrew didn't want to. And how you interpret this--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:34:03\n\nI guess one question I have is, do you think he was essential? Like, the question is: why is it so difficult for groups to self-generate? Why is it so often it is a guru to ge--? Like, what role... Why was... Was he quite central to it then coming into being in the first place? And why did he not see... Well, who knows for him why he didn't see the wisdom of stepping aside, but I guess this kind of difficulty, I guess, is: do you need something like that to create the space in the first place, but then somehow step out of the way?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:34:53\n\nYeah, I guess that's one of the lessons one can draw. That is part of the difficulty of it, because of course, it helps also to have a powerful holder of this. But the nature of this different step of human interrelatedness needs something different than pyramid power structures. And I'm not saying that authority is bad, because--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:35:25\n\nYes. \n\nThomas Steininger 1:35:26\n\n\\--to flatland everything is also not the answer. So yes, how to do this in a dialogical way, and to honour authority and expertise at the same time, in a flexible way of honouring who we are also in our differences... That's demanding. It's not easy. And that's why this also produces a lot of experiments that fail. But that's also part of the process. And we are in the process of finding out how we can do that, to honour a lot of contradicting things at the same time. Because I don't think that pyramid structures really can serve for the future. And postmodern, flatland non-hierarchies are incapable also. So what is the integration? And I also have no real problem with failing because I think failing is part of the success in the end.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:36:33\n\n\\[...\\] So to come to a sort of related question that we come back to... you know, Integral, Ken Wilber, and the Integral room is much bigger than Ken Wilber and involves many, many people who've contributed. What are the lessons again of that? I mean, I am someone who's kind of come to it a bit later, you know, in the last few \\[years\\]. But what... I mean, I think that if you Google, the top hit for Ken Wilber or something is this essay by Manson. The guy, I think, who wrote this sort of self-help book, but who's obviously really inspired by Ken Wilber. But \\[the article is\\] called The Rise and Fall of Ken Wilber, or something, and he starts the article: 'he's like the greatest genius you've never heard of'. But again, I don't want to-- I don't necessarily think that-- I think that we have a tendency in our world to focus on things that are successful, because there's an entity that's really visible, that's really successful, you know; things that are successful because they influence the entire culture are not so. But what do you see has happened with the Integral community? What are your hopes? And where do you think it's evolving to? Where is it showing up in other places? And what lessons are there that other communities, which are coming into being, that are emerging, could learn from that?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:37:53\n\nAgain, one simple answer to a very complex question. I'm very happy about the emergence of Metamodern. And one reason why I am: because I think that any new stage of human culture and consciousness has to be multilingual. And that the emergent existence of Metamodern -- also partly in competition with Integral, partly in identity -- in my understanding is a support of Integral because it allows whatever this new stage in culture and consciousness is about, to find different voices in also hopefully friendly competition, to analyse what it is and not just coming from one source. So, in that sense, I really think that Integral becoming polyphone is a support of Integral. And that Ken has here a monumentous role in what happened and what he brought about and that he has his own genius and that for me is unquestioned and of course he has also his limitations and his downsides. But, I mean, he played an enormous role in my life, that's maybe beside the point, but that really shaped a lot of my life and my understanding of reality. I think that to honour this and to find a polyphonic relationship to that, as every stage of consciousness, tradition, modern, postmodern, came in different voices and competing voices is a support that there's something really new happening right now. And some people call it Integral. Some people call it Metamodern. And some people will find it a third name for that. And I think that's good. \n\nRufus Pollock 1:40:10\n\nAnd what do you think a key...? What is the kind of essence...? I give the analogy sometimes for people in discussing this of the Reformation leading into the Enlightenment -- the great last transition, you might say, if you reflect -- and let's say, the Reformation, which I think is actually a key point and you can go early Renaissance, but in essence was actually sort of an individuality, like, you know, each person found their way to God. So, you know, by Scripture alone, etc. There were, and it's a good example, there were many, many different Protestant sects. There were many different people with different views. But there were certain key commonalities, maybe, fundamentally, to, for example, Protestantism, and then ultimately, there are many different takes on some degree aspects of modernity. But they had this kind of... they were common. So as I said, one individual route to God or, you know, the importance of reading for oneself, the Bible: these were common aspects. So you got the Quakers all at one end, and you got, I don't know, the Anglicans... there's a huge spectrum. I know--\n\nThomas Steininger 1:41:22\n\nLuther and Calvin, being two voices that had a lot not in common, but at the same time--\n\nRufus Pollock 1:41:29\n\nYeah, and a lot not in common. So I guess when I hear Wilber or Integral speak, it would be stuff like there was a unifying principle -- that's my point, there's a lot of divergence, but the key principle, let's say, in Integral would be just the assumption of the possibility of human growth, consciousness growth and evolution, the reality of that. And that there's no end, like it's not like we've got the right answer to this kind of aspect. I don't know, maybe I'm not putting that rightly, but what would you say? Are there any underlying core principles, though, which many polyphonic voices are maybe versions of? But what are kind of core assumptions, like the Protestants have certain core assumptions that you can identify?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:42:09\n\nWhat comes to my mind? First is one thing. And that is the integration of the Modern impulse and the Postmodern impulse into something new. Because, at least in my understanding, Post-Modernity is not really a new stage in consciousness. Post-Modernity is Modernity in the face of self-critique. It's the deconstruction of Modernity. It's not the new yet. At least, one could argue this point.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:42:53\n\nIt's like Scholasticism. Medieval Scholasticism was a kind of integration at the beginning, but into the old system of the discovery of Plato, Aristotle. But it wasn't... yes, it was a kind of critique or building on, but not yet the next stage.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:43:11\n\nSo in this impulse to really take serious what Post-Modernity is teaching us in terms of the flaws of the Western scientistic, hyper-individualistic, separate, subject-object divide perspective of reality that distinguishes -- I'm oversimplifying dramatically, forgive me -- \\[that\\] distinguishes this western, Greek, European impulse from traditional impulses and other impulses of other cultures around the world, and that created the triumph and the disaster of modernity. And postmodernity is very much basically the relentless self-critique of that. And Integral/Metamodern is a way to acknowledge this critique, for example, the subject-object divide of the Modern perspective. Also, the reduction to materialism, to basically that only things that we can measure with scientific methodologies are accepted as being reality and everything that shows up just in its phenomenological form is not real. All these kinds of things that Modernity and the Modern did for us is very flawed, but, at the same time, to acknowledge again the dignity of this Modern impulse and find this in new forms of holding bigger complexities, where this can be brought together, seems to be one \\[thing\\] that these different forms of Integral and Metamodern try to achieve in similar or different ways.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:45:14\n\nSo that integrating of the Modern, like respecting reason -- so, neither throwing out the baby with the bathwater, sort of keeping the baby of Modernity, the value of reason, the value of meritocracy, the value of expertise, even, you know, material developments. While also integrating the great critique of that. \\[...\\] It's odd because Post-Modernism doesn't really have quite the interiority, the respect for... But maybe  I'm being unfair to Post-Modernism. The point is that we're integrating certainly the spiritual line back into things, integrating a phenomenological and the inner world into things. That it. So it's kind of funny, because you might say that it's the time for the birth of a new whole religion, or a spiritual thing that integrates that. And I know many people talk to that. I talked about it before. And, I know, many others in this space. And Ken -- one of his most recent books is The Religion, I think, Of Tomorrow or The Religion of the Future. So I guess that impulse, that integration is a key aspect. Is there anything else you see as a key aspect of these different polyphonic voices? If we were to write out our theses?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:46:41\n\nIt's interesting because I think it's central. But I may be biased because it's so much where my focus on it is. And in Integral, it's only partially developed. But I think, to develop a perspective of reality that is beyond the separate, individual self-sense seems to be part of the equation here. But I'm a little hesitant to say that because on one hand this is so dear to my heart. And on the other hand, I see it in certain forms of Integral only half-heartedly pursued in that, but, still, my conviction is that this is a central part of the puzzle.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:47:41\n\nAnd finally, I guess, what are the things we could learn, like with everything, what have the limitations been of the Integral... maybe movement or community or practices? \\[...\\] They may even be recognised in the community. \\[...\\] But what if we were like, 'What can we learn from the last thirty, forty years of Integral's efforts?' The successes and the things that haven't worked so well. Like other groups, you know, and other movements. I mean, I know Craig Walsh wrote this 2007, I think, address to the European Integral Congress or something like that. But it was like, Ken is very clear in the work, but, you know, it can be quite heady. He himself had a very strong practice. But Craig mentioned, I think, in his address, like, we really need to make sure we're doing the work, the inner work, the actual practice, rather than this just being ideas. That's one thing that I can see in any, you know, I see for myself, I can see in any group that it's often quite easy to be like, 'oh, yeah, we've got all these great ideas' -- you know, it's true of any political movements -- but then it's not the practice. Going back to your first point of this whole call, we're not practising what we're preaching and that's crucial. Is that one thing? Or what other things would you say that there are that we can really learn to do even better? That were being done well and can be done even better? Or that we're maybe missing, have not done...?\n\nThomas Steininger 1:49:10\n\nNo, I think you've pointed it out. And I really think one of the flaws and blind spots, and maybe even the shadow sides, of Integral is the temptation of the theory that explains everything. Because there is a temptation, and I saw this in many cases, particularly in young, intelligent men, to kind of be so drawn into this capacity to put everything into maps. So that basically, you only live in maps anymore. And I see this, sometimes, to my experience, \\[as\\] very tragic. Because I see people who have deep spiritual longing, but from my perspective, \\[they're\\] completely lost in maps. When I see them, my experience is, they don't see anything but maps, even when they see you, all they can do is mapping you. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but because of the powerful capacity of these maps, they've lost touch with everything else. And this is something that happened because of the capacities of Integral theory. And because there can be a trap, you can be trapped in. And I seek... Again, it's just my perspective. But I really experience quite some tragic lives in this, where I see very sad people with high intelligent and high spirit longing, but somehow lost in this. And that is something, I think, which is connected to a blind spot, or to a shadow side of how Integral showed up until now. And again, I don't think there's anything on earth that does not show up with bias or positionality.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:51:22\n\nWow. Well, I mean, I think also that humility is a really central point as well. But not coupled with then doing nothing. Like, there's this dance, and you say we hold our view, but we hold it with a listening for others. I wanted to say at this point, anything last you'd like to say during this interview, Thomas, that you'd like to share at the very end, or anything that we haven't covered that you'd like to mention.\n\nThomas Steininger 1:51:52\n\nNo, just I appreciate very much the conversation that we had, and to all this very theoretical, but also very personal dimension of this. And this shared search, how can we find the step forward in our individual practice and but also in our, if I may call it activism, to find more integrative forms of culture, and living together on this planet, with this planet? And kind of having this conversation is for me part of the practice.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:52:28\n\nWell, thank you so much. Thank you, everyone, for listening. And please, if you want to find out more about Thomas's work, you can check out Evolve and Evolve World. And, yeah, just a great thank you to you. And also I just want to acknowledge your partner, Elizabeth, who I knew unfortunately couldn't make it today, but was here in presence with us on this. Just acknowledging all of her contribution. And the many others. You've already acknowledged some of your kind of intellectual and spiritual ancestors on this call. So thank you to them as well. Until next time!\n\nThomas Steininger 1:53:03\n\nThank you so much, Rufus.\n"},{"title":"Joseph Henrich and the Emergence of a (Rigorous) Culturology","image":"/assets/images/Youtube-Thumbnail-Template-8.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"eilidhross","name":"Eilidh Ross","avatar":"/assets/images/IMG_6159-scaled-e1653305020765.jpg","body":{"raw":"\nEilidh studied Law at the University of Oxford before moving back home to Scotland to gain an MSc in Media, Communications and International Journalism from the University of Glasgow.

I have the privilege today of being joined by Professor Joe Henrich. He is the Ruth Moore Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. And he is the author of several books, most recently, two widely read popular books, The Weirdest People in the World, and The Secret of Our Success. He has had a unique career in many ways, because his trajectory has taken him across, as actually being a tenured professor, across multiple disciplines; in anthropology, in economics, in psychology, and human evolutionary biology. It's an absolute privilege to have you on the show, Joe, thank you so much for joining us. And I wonder if we could just start by you telling us a little bit about that unique career trajectory? Like what what got you interested in this? What motivated you and what was your kind of path a little bit?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 01:01\n\nYeah, so first, it's good to be with you. So when I was an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame, I went to study aerospace engineering. And in my first year, I took a course in anthropology. And I was interested in it, but I wasn't ready to give up the engineering. So I was fortunate that Notre Dame had a dual degree programme where you could get a degree in arts and sciences, or arts and letters, and then a degree in engineering. So I have a BA and a BS undergraduate degree, it took five years, but that allowed me to study both anthropology and engineering. I went and did engineering for a few years, working at an undisclosed location in Northern Virginia, and while I was doing that, I was thinking, well, do I want to continue on this path and maybe consider graduate school - I wanted to study space propulsion - or, you know, explore anthropology more and go into that. And so after two years of doing engineering, I quit and moved to California and enrolled in an anthropology programme at UCLA. And then, you know, I wanted to do a science of culture, a science of anthropology. And the professor that I started working with, he had done that too, although it wasn't very fashionable at the time. And as I was working there, I began reading more widely and bringing in tools from other disciplines and just kind of pursuing that. And then I found another professor at UCLA called Robert Boyd and Boyd had kind of been working, you know, he hadn't had students and he was working very much alone, building mathematical models of cultural evolution. So I got really interested in that, and really went from there trying to build an empirical programme around some of the mathematical models that Boyd and his collaborator Pete Richerson had built.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 02:49\n\nWe'll come to other things. So this is fascinating. I mean, just an aside for me. And I'm gonna interject like I, when I got in, I was an economist for a while, I was interested in the kind of evolution of knowledge and knowledge kind of production in a more formal economic sense. But then I had also come from a mathematical background, I'd studied math, originally. And I got into like branching processes and stuff like that. So I just kind of like, take me back to that part, which you said he kind of had no students, like, why was this? This was kind of rare in anthropology, right, at the time?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 03:20\n\nYeah, it was. I mean, this is all public knowledge, I think. UCLA wanted to hire Rob's wife, whose name is Joan Silk, and she's now a renowned primatologist. So it was a very smart hire. But he was a spousal hire that was kind of trailing along. He doesn't have a degree in anthropology. He has a PhD in ecology and an undergraduate in physics. And so he gets hired as the spousal hire. And he's just building these mathematical models, which seems very odd and foreign to all anthropologists, including the people at UCLA. He did work with one guy named Bob Unger, but he wasn't technically his advisor. So I was really his first, you know, advisee-type student. But then, for whatever reason, two years after I kind of showed up on the scene, he brought in two other new students. And then we very quickly began working together. And Richard McElreath, who was my friend from graduate school, is now director of one of the Max Planck institutes.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 04:18\n\nYeah. I also guess what I'm asking is in anthropology, that wasn't common, that approach, which is, I guess, mathematical, and you said, building models of kind of cultural evolution and phylogeny ie what is the kind of tree of of culture. What I would also kind of lead into is, this trajectory that you've then gone on, there has been sort of an explosion in a way in this area. What's driving that and what's kind of cooking, what's evolving? Because, what I would say is very interesting, moments happen obviously, we could kind of almost be a bit meta here, like the evolution of disciplines, just as like cognitive science, which is now kind of a major discipline, which has all these connections, it's partly under psychology, but it brings in other stuff, there are these very fruitful moments when different disciplines come together and something kind of significant and new emerges. Do you feel that kind of thing has been happening over the space of your career in the area you're in?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 05:22\n\nYeah, so certainly over the last two decades or a bit longer, there's been an explosion of the field that we now call 'Cultural Evolution', although it didn't have that name until about 2010. And that has brought together psychologists, linguists, economists, anthropologists, and others scattered from around the social sciences. And, you know, now there's a society and a lot of interest, I think, and a lot of publications in general science journals like Nature Human Behaviour. Now, this traces back to work that really began in the late 1970s, where first Cavalli-Sforza and Mark Feldman got together and they wrote a book called Cultural Transmission and Evolution published in 1981. And meanwhile, Boyd and Richerson also began working, they published their first paper on this in 1976, around the same time that Richard Dawkins begins to put the selfish meme idea out there. So there's some kind of interest going on, you know, culture wars are going on, because there are socio biologists who are trying to explain human behaviour with evolution. And then there's people going, Oh, but what about culture, you know, humans are cultural. And what these guys are doing is they're trying to think very systematically about culture and, you know, build models of it, but then also say, this has to flow within some kind of evolutionary model. So Boyd and Richerson really distil all this in their 1985 book, where they assume we're products of natural selection, we're animals, but we're animals who rely heavily on learning from other people and that we have specialised mechanisms in our heads that allow us to, from a young age, learn language and social norms, and how to use tools, and all those kinds of things that we think of as culture. So it seats culture within a broader evolutionary framework, and then allows us to think systematically about where do ethnic groups come from. Well, let's start with humans as learners, and why would you, why would ethnic groups ever pop up? And you can ask questions at the sociological level.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 07:23\n\nI guess one question I'm asking there, just to go back, which is, you know, anthropology had, I mean, anthropology is a young discipline. And I don't know, I don't want to make myself foolish, but you know, we're talking 100 years, obviously, there's much stuff older than that, but we're talking 100, a bit over 100 years. But why, like, there's kind of this subdiscipline again, you know, I'm not an anthropologist, but there's culutural anthropology, but this was kind of like that, this hadn't been such, it would be much more qualitative, right? There's something kind of, there's mathematical models, there's then a tendency to want to go test this, you're describing certain things that have been coming up, part of that might be you're saying is just genetics had got more rigorous and got, and was kind of getting more, you know, The Selfish Gene, the very fact that we had a rich genetics was inspiring the idea of mimetics. But what was it, is it also there's been a revolution in data, because that's one if you were doing was then going out and starting to empirically, like, you know, for me, or you are trying to empirically look at things and for me, like one lease from reading your books was just this kind of idea of like, Oh, you were kind of going through economics to the ultimatum game, you know, are there replicable standardised kind of things would give me kind of cross cultural data that isn't just like, we've got a lot of data, I think it's in the Yale database, we've got a lot of data on like, marriage practices, but it's not kind of, it's not able to be kind of like standardised in a way that's going to allow us to make as good cross cultural analysis. So I guess I'm trying to ask also, what was it that led to the empirical revolution, or allowed these kind of folk ideas become more rigorous? \n\n**Joe Henrich** 08:57\n\nSo I mean, the one key thing, so I started to talk about what I began doing in the 90s. But that was, I was running directly upstream against what was going on in anthropology, because anthropology was becoming less rigorous and less quantitative, and less interested in that kind of stuff. The history is complex in anthropology, but, you know, beginning with Franz Boas who's considered the founder of American anthropology, there was a rich effort to go out into the world and just record, figure out what people are doing, do a lot of in depth ethnography, counting and quantifying was okay, but really you wanted to do a lot of ethnography. The group at Yale with the Human Relations Area Files, George Peter Murdock began, you know, at least quantifying things at the societal level so we could compare different societies and look at different patterns of kinship or language or all these kinds of cool things. So it was quantitative and it stays quantitative up until the 1970s. And then, you know, anthropology begins with a spread of postmodernism, french structuralism, it begins completely rejecting anything quantitative. And really, kind of unwittingly and stupidly, I show up and my advisors are older, right, they're of the pre generation, they're of the generation that was still quantitative. And so, you know, my advisor, my first advisor, not Rob Boyd, a guy named Allen Johnson, had written a book in the 70s called 'Quantification in Cultural Anthropology', which started to talk about how we could use computers and how we can do systematic data collection. But he was really an old dog, and he, you know, the trend in the field was going directly away from him. But, you know, I had an enterprise that I wanted to do and, you know, Boyd and Richerson had all this theory. So I just started picking out tools from other disciplines. So, in addition to harvesting things from behavioural economics, like the ultimatum game, I was also, you know, working with Richard Nisbett, for example, and taking tools from psychology, trying to measure psychological variation around the world. And I was, you know, I didn't know she was going to win a Nobel Prize, but I was reading Elinor Ostrom just because, you know, she was doing interesting work on cooperation and I was learning about public goods games.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 11:13\n\nYeah, okay. So one interesting thing is this, these kind of like, even a cultural tide within a discipline influence stuff, and there's kind of been a change, whether it's in anthropology, but this is kind of coming together. So maybe just kind of let's step that forward, is that there's this emerging, I guess in the background here, there's an emerging discipline, you're calling it 'cultural evolution'. I like to joke sometimes what happened to culturology, you know, in a way, what happened to the science and the study of culture? I mean, it's not in any discipline, but we want, that seems just to central to humanity, and what, what kind of, so if we kind of looked into that, in your, in your then evolution, you see that happening, the study of cultural evolution, what are some of the building blocks, and first of all maybe just for myself, and it's such an obvious thing, but what do we mean by culture here? I know, this is a kind of chestnut, but just roughly, what are we talking about when we say we're studying culture?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 12:11\n\nYeah, so the core idea is that people learn stuff, right? So culture is information that got in our heads through some kind of learning process, usually a social learning process. And what we're doing when we're building a model of cultural evolution is we're tracking that information in individual minds through time. The evolution, this sort of natural selection, genetic side of it, comes into it, because once we say, well, okay, that's probably an important thing in humans, we can say, well, how might natural selection have shaped us to make us good cultural learners? What kinds of things should we pay attention to? How should we integrate information from different people in an effective adaptive way that allows an individual to better navigate the world? But then once you have a group of individuals, a population doing that, then you get these population-level phenomena. So one of the things you know, economics has got interested in institutions in the last 25 years, but that's really, they came kind of down to that, right? They were trying to solve higher level questions. Cltural evolution had to cobble up to figure out what an institution is; okay, people learn stuff, then we get social norms, and what's an institution, well an institution is a collection of social norms that regulate a certain area like marriage. And then when we put laws on top of that, that's typically what economists think of as institutions, when you have kind of legally regulated rules for interacting.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 13:32\n\nYes. Okay. What I also want to mark in there is therefore, what you're also mentioning, is that across different disciplines, this thing of the culture, we're kind of, there's a convergence from several directions, economists may be converging down towards that, because it's kind of the base layer, culture. I mean, even below it, and we're going to talk about that, is kind of, you might say, I would call it ontology, maybe we just call it psychology, to not have a fancy term, but what gives our views and values and way of being, who do we conceive ourselves to be, strictly that's psychology, but it's also a bit richer. There's these kind of layers down, there's kind of like, there's the formal institutions, there's kind of the informal, there's, there's then there's psychology, and culture's near the bottom of that. I think you've got quite a broad definition, which is strictly like, it's hard to determine where culture and formal institutions separate because some of the people debate about like, you know, is it culturre or is it institutions, or is it you know, genetic, genetic, you know, kind of inbuilt psychology. And the other direction is kind of building up in what you're saying is that we've been able to get better and better tools in kind of, I don't wanna call it scientific anthropology or science, you know, where we can go upwards of people's beliefs into aggregating that and how that forms institutions.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 14:58\n\nYeah. So there's a few other trends going on at this time, which I think are interesting. So, within psychology, there's this older field of cross cultural psychology where they had been kind of using psychological tools in different societies. But for reasons I don't totally understand, it remained relegated to the peripheries of psychology through most of its history. Then, in 1991, Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama published a paper in a lead psychology journal, which really sparks up this field called 'cultural psychology'. And then Dick Nisbett gets in the act and studies the culture of honour. And then the field of cultural psychology really begins to take off. And they don't really know what they're doing with culture and they don't have a very good theory of culture, but they do know that they're finding psychological differences among populations, that previously the field would have said that these weren't expected. And then in economics, Rob Boyd, my advisor who I was telling you about, he's in this MacArthur group with Sam Bowles, Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr and a lot of behavioural economists. And then we begin doing experiments across different societies, and that gets economics, at least a corner of economics, more interested in culture and stuff. And there seems to be a recognition that in order to address the, the rise of the West question, and why some countries are rich, and some countries are poor, maybe at least legal origins might matter? And once you have legal origins, then why did different countries have different legal origins? And then you begin to pull the thread, right?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 16:39\n\nYeah, you pull the thread. I mean, listen, I mean, this is for me, going back, I mentioned I'm a Zen Buddhist and, you know, so I got intersted because I was interested in happiness research, but also I was a Buddhist, and, you know, you open any econ textbook, and like, the beginning is, you know, economics is about the allocation of scarce resources you know, with unlimited want, this, you know, I literally open a textbook of my 15 year old nephew the other day, and this is it. And I was seeing this as a Buddhist saying, okay, but at least with happiness, crude Buddhism, I'm going to simplify it, but you know, is like, preferences are changeable, you know, your suffering arises because you've got, not because you just got preferences, but you've got cravings. You can transform craving, and that's the path to true liberation. You know, can you imagine, it's kind of like the inverse, that you should spend all your attention as a human being on like, basically, transforming your inner self, rather than trying to acquire things, which is kind of economics, externally to satisfy them. And what's funny is you go into economic literature at this point in the mid 2000s, when I was doing this, and you're like, there are these models called endogenous preferences, which in economics, you'll know, is fancy terminology for like your preferences can change within the system. And they kind of die out in the 70s, traditionally, because they're too complicated, basically, which is unfortunate, like in macro stuff, they lead to like weird equilibria, and so on. And they only get resurrected, actually, by rational addiction, like the Chicago school use a bunch of them in like the 90s and 2000s for rational addiction models of smoking, you know? But it's like, it's in a weird way, this is one of these things which should have been almost existential to the core economics, because once you think culture is significant, you're like, well, what creates culture, what creates being? And you have some of this in \\[unintelligible - 00:18:30\\], who's your colleague, but you know, there is this stuff on like, bounded rationality and self control, you know, like, I only have so much - this is big in psychology, like ego mode management - self control, what do I spend it on? But that goes deep, like, should I spend my limited self control, or like working hard to acquire stuff, or work hard meditating, for example, right? If you really ran this, you'd be in a very interesting place of like, what shakes being and how should we we, you know, do that? Yeah.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 19:01\n\nYeah, so I've had this discussion frequently with economists over the years, and the answers have changed, which is, I think, a good thing from my point of view. So, I mean, a good example is Sam Bowles wrote a paper around 1997, which is, it's got endogenous preferences in the title. And it's basically making the case, using lots of different evidence from before that, that humans have endogenous preferences. It's a great paper, but it doesn't go anywhere, right? Or at least, I mean, eventually it turns out to have a big impact but it wasn't like it was on everybody's lips or anything. It didn't have a big immediate impact. I think for the reasons you're suggesting it was a very slow takeoff. People like Nathan Nunn had to get into the development people in there and the economic history people. But whenever I've brought this up and I would start saying things obnoxious to economist like, we know people acquire preferences via cultural learning, I can give you a big pile of evidence to show, so we know preferences are endogenous, why are you assuming they're exogenous? And it was basically the kind of mathematical argument, you said if, if preferences can move around, there's too many parts moving. And we can't, so we're just going to assume this is fixed. And that can't be the right answer.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 20:14\n\nThat can't be the right answer. And it's sort of kind of profound here. And I mean, I'll give you other practical examples that really touched me. So let's say, you know, let's say you're interested in education policy, and this is one of my favourite examples. Generally, people talk about Finland, as one example, we won't get to debate right now about how well Finland, but certainly, for example, when the first set of cross country assessment came out, which was the OECD PISA stuff, and it came out also, when people didn't know it was a test, which was really important, because once you have a test for a reasonable period of time, it becomes rubbish, unfortunately, because people teach to it. Finland like ace this, you know, it came top or close to the top. And you ask them a question about, well, how can you reproduce the Finnish education system? A lot of our world today will go like, Oh, they have their schools laid out like this, or they have a curriculum like that. But then you say, well, it's actually the culture. For example, if you go and read books, you interview people, they're like, well, you know, we have really high trust of our teachers, also, pupils tend to respect them, or we have a society where being a primary school teacher is the number one desired profession as a woman. And yet, then huge amounts of ink will get, which is kind of, I would say, is a cultural-type explanation. Now, of course, you can influence that by structuring, you know, paying teachers more, but again, they're not actually paying teachers that much more. But it's higher status, it's high prestige, yes. And that's another point, I've actually got a quote, I got it an excerpt from your book. And we should come to that. I think at one point where you say, prestige is a universal amongst cultures. But what is kind of given prestige, what gives you to acquire prestige, whether it's growing big yams - I'm paraphrasing your quote - whether it's growing big yams, or being great, is incredibly variable. And given the centrality of that to what we do in the world, is it high prestige to like consume lots of stuff and be really famous? Or is it high prestige to be a really brilliant scientist? Or is it high prestige to look after the environment? You know, we can kind of just see obviously in front of our eyes, the profound impacts, those things are going to have on our society and very major challenges we face from the climate crisis, to education to inequality to you name it. So just kind of going back on that endogenous preferences, the point for listeners is, there's a revolution happening, in a positive way. I would say economics is the dominant discipline of our age, for good or ill. You know, what I mean, is it reflects the kind of, at least for policymakers or the elite, often a way of thinking about the world and a dominant kind of social policy tool, whether it's abused, I, you know, having been an economist who's given advice to government, you know, I'm not, I'm not blaming, you know, economists for all that happens. But there's a really big revolution that you're describing is happening, potentially, and even is bubbling up in things like economics, where this primacy of culture and the primacy of being, the amount of evidence that's there is really becoming massive, and that can have some profound impacts, is what you're saying.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 23:33\n\nAnd I mean, I think we should, I mean, economics deserves a hat tip in the sense that I really think in the last 15 years, the field's been very responsive. And there's, you know, I see lots of young economists taking these questions on and, you know, thinking thoughts they wouldn't have done so in the 90s.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 23:49\n\nI really want to acknoledge that, I think one of the great strengths is quite empirically, the heavy empirical orientation is fantastic. I think the point I would just flag to you, is that going to this point about endogenous preferences, while it is described as a technical barrier, just to go back to like, what would a Buddhist economics look like? There's something kind of baked in, you know, if you go back to Pareto, you know, who weirdly I read about in a sociological survey by Raymond Aron of sociologists like Durkheim and \\[unintelligible - 00:24:19\\], there's something quite deep in the economic way of seeing the world that goes back even to kind of early modernity that's under threat if you take this model seriously. If you take culture and ontology and psychology really seriously. I'll just take one other example here that comes from Buddhism: my preference is not fixed, but also knowing what I really want is hard. And therefore, we live in a society today, I'll just point out, where basically the two things that underpin our most good, summum bonum, which is consumption in the free market and voting and democracy, are both based on the assumption that people know what they want. Now, of course, economists are kind of knocking at the door, you know, Fishing for Fools is written by two Nobel Prize winners, they were economists, but the challenge has always been that really calls into question some profound things about Western society if you keep running with it, just as, I would in analogy with your book, Protestantism called into question profound norms about the nature of the pre modern world, i.e. where did authority come from, how did you decide about things, you know solo scripture or individualism, which, as you point out, had come from a long history of context. But I just point out that, yeah, I think as a scientific discipline, but that's kind of a seismic shift in society as we start to take your and other work seriously.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 25:54\n\nYeah, that makes sense to me. I mean, just as a practical level, as someone who sometimes finds himself advising young PhD students in economics, is it's still the case that everybody wants a utility function, and that they really want to, you know, they might have an interesting empirical result, but they've got to figure out how to get that result from, you know, a utility function that they have to use to get the result. So and in the sense that individuals as optimizers, you gotta be optimising something and, you know, sometimes in our models of cultural evolution, we think people are very much choosing unconsciously, and they're not weighing costs and benefits in the way suggested by the Standard Model.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 26:35\n\nYes. So I wanted to build on that this kind of primacy of being thesis, like kind of coming from this emergence of a new discipline of cultural evolution. Anthropology as we put it, in my sense, when I went to university was, it wasn't like economics is prestigious, there's massively endowed business schools and so on. We can see a future where maybe, whatever the department you're in, this new science of culture is going to be pretty major and central to our kind of intellectual field. That's kind of a thesis that I think we're exploring here. Could you say what you think the directions that would go in like over the next 10 or 20 years? Or that you might like to see it go in? What do you think are the trends here? And what are the gaps?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 27:28\n\nSo I would like to see what you're saying be correct, but I'm not sure it's going to be correct, because, I mean, universities are still so ossified. So it's hard to imagine a university ever saying, um, we're creating a Department of Cultural Evolution. I mean, just to give you a sense, so at Harvard, like many places, the quote \"sciences\" are under one dean and one administrative unit, and then other things are in other administrative units. But the field of cultural evolution takes seriously genetic evolution, thinks of humans as a kind of animal studies, epigenetics and how that might affect cultural preferences. And at the same time, is interested in you know, where do ethnic groups come from, how does social stratification emerge, what leads to innovation, all things that you would find in economics and sociology and other kinds of fields like that, also religion. So I'm interested in the origins and evolution of religion or religions, none of which would normally be on with the biologists and physicists, right? So the organisation of the university makes it hard to have a Department of Cultural Evolution. Now you can always have centres and stuff and there are centres. At the Arizona State University, they have the Department of Human Evolution and Social Change, which is actually kind of an experiment, I guess, where they have the anthropologists together with lots of other disciplines. So that's a case. My department, human evolutionary biology, we sit with the physicists and the biologists, but we do have people who stretch across into these other disciplines like economics. Now, so I'm actually going to a meeting of leading scholars from different disciplines in November, and basically our charge is, that we've given ourselves, is to design a proper and interdisciplinary social science. So for example, a simple question to ask yourself is how would you train a graduate student? You know, and so I, you know, I want them to know how to do ethnography, like I think one of the problems of development economics is that you gotta go there and live among the population to really understand what's going on, but, you know, it's also good to have an instrumental variable or to conduct randomised field trials or all the kinds of things we see in modern economics. So I want all those tools to be available and at the ready for a young student\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 30:09\n\nOne thing you've just mentioned about the future and what gets in the way, particularly, maybe of this term 'culture' is that it's interdisciplinarity, and particularly, it's not interdisciplinarity in the sciences. It's not like biologists and physicists need to hang out, which is already a challenge, it's that biologists need to hang out with anthropologists. And so there's this kind of structural, a general ossification problem. You know, and I am no longer in academia, but I still collaborate and so on, so I know that. So that's one kind of institutional, cultural thing. Let's say things went well, what are kind of the topics you'd like to see studied or like, what are the kind of gaps that are really interesting? To give a concrete example, it seems that you have examples in your book and maybe you can now give some, where we can study a particular feature, you know, you know it might be the way people are going to prepare manioc for eating. Or they're gonna, you know, avoid pellagra by preparing cornmeal in a certain way, you can mention these from your book. Those are very specific, but then what we could call like, memeplexes in another area, like, maybe marriage and family, the marriage and family programme for your Weirdest People example, or even, like, puritanism or sometimes you say the Western world. So they're these much bigger levels, kind of like whole constellations of values, views, beliefs, practices. And you know, from another area that I come from, people have these kind of grand unified theories, which are in fashion in physics, but not in social sciences, you know, there are like major waves of human cultural development. I don't know if you've heard of teal organisations, have you heard of this term teal organisation? No? So there's a guy called Ken Wilber and spiral dynamics, I don't know, this is a whole different topic, which was kind of interested in human development in a broad sense. And this is like people in Harvard and other places, you also got interested in like lifespan development, you know, how do humans evolve over the lifespan, not just developmental psychology. There's a small population of people who kind of did some quite radical stuff, you know, this, Robert Keegan, who you might have heard of, right, which is people can kind of become self transcending, or Maslow, you know, self transcendence, not just self actualizing, we do have data on this stuff. Then what came up was that there was this argument that people's kind of values could evolve in substantive ways, like, you know, we start out focused on me, that's both as a tiny child, but there's an analogy with cultures, cultures are focused on, you know, the big man or something like that. This is very crude simplification now of anthropological evolutionary history. But there's points, like we, for example, we expand our domain of concern from me, to my tribe, to larger groups, and ultimately to the world and then to all beings, for example. And this kind of background have these grand theories of these kind of cultural stages of humanity. And why this has then showed up and been very influential is - maybe more in the management consulting and this discussion of teal organisations - these people who came up with this grand unified theory, ended up using colours. So there's like red societies, red is like the mafia and like, it's all about the strong man or woman. And there's this kind of spectrum. So modernity in this spectrum is orange. It's all about rationality, it's all about reason, it's all about meritocracy, it's about bureaucracy. And then the next age has been kind of more like egalitarian, post modernism, it's, you know, they have this grand unified theory that these standard kind of things that highly correlate, you know in a principal components analysis, it'd be like these different dimensions of values of use that highly correlate to reduce to a smaller dimensional draft. And the teal phase is the next one. And so there is a highly influential book called Reinventing Organisations, influential in Silicon Valley and other places about, we need organisations that are much flatter, but where people have a lot more autonomy, but they also are responsible, where they can kind of coordinate in different ways. And for me, by the way, reading your work, one of the connections was what was this revolution of puritanism, of the reformation. This did, maybe in this case through a religion or some set of views and values, shape how people could coordinate and organise in a radically different way and much more maybe egalitarian way, much more effective way, because people could self police in their heads a bit, you know, God's watching them and so on all these classic stories about it. So, to kind of come back to the question I was asking you, where are we in the science of this? We have now examples, and maybe you could describe, where we can trace a given practice, and it's maybe phylogeny, or its development, or at least demonstrate, you know, certain practices are culturally transmitted. And then you have an example in your book of the marriage of family programmes and quite big one, and how that influenced. But where are we in, like, you know, one day, are we going to be able to say, wow, you know, we can explain how this, you know, this new whole culture evolved, you know, or there's a new pocket of something really new emerging over here in, you know, in the southwestern United States, where, you know, it's got these different features that have never been seen before, together, of a cultural behaviour.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 36:03\n\nSo, the field, because it focuses on individual learners, at least at the core, an approach like that would be say you're broadly interested in democracy, and you would look at what kinds of cultural beliefs in a population tend to foster the spread of democratic norms, democratic practices, and you could study things like the school committee's vote or how do families operate, do kids have a vote at the dinner table or where they're going to go the next day or something like that. But then, once you begin to get practices like that, the question will be how did those beliefs and practices and institutions, what kinds of things do they attract? Do they make certain other ideas more likely? So for example, one idea that I've toyed with, and it's hard to get good data on it, but the idea that the spread of monogamous marriage may have actually created a milieu that made democracy more likely to spread. And historians have suggested this as well. So that's two unrelated things that you might not normally put together, but because of the way that enforced monogamy alters the marriage pattern for elite men, that might create more equity within families and give women more bargaining power in the household and that may encourage more democracy, right? That's just one kind of hypothesis. But in any case, so we'll be able to say, well, the hope is that we'll be able to say how different practices and beliefs affect each other, thinking about a population and either acquiring or not acquiring these kinds of beliefs. Some ideas, we're going to learn, fit better with aspects of human nature, so they're more readily to get picked up. Maybe there are ideas and practices that don't fit as well with human nature, but are really good for getting people to cooperate, and you need to have a lot of socialisation practices, rituals, other kinds of institutions that help get these hard-to-think practices and ideas into people's heads. So it'll be a kind of complex articulation of psychology, cultural and sort of innate psychology, with all the bits and pieces that form a society, and then thinking about how those bits and pieces fit together. This stuff you were describing with the stages makes me really nervous, because that's not the picture that's emerging; those are made up.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 38:27\n\nRight, exactly. It's much richer than that, I think. What I guess I would want to ask, which kind of came out of that though, for myself, was when I was asking about the future of the field, one question I guess I would have, is there are things like the World Values Survey, or the European Values Survey. If we had better data, you know I sat there more informally and was like, okay, if one had quite detailed stuff, and you might get it now out of Facebook or things, can you see new norms almost emerging in real time? Just like in genetics, we might say, okay, we haven't seen this gene, this is a new mutation, this is a new thing and we're going to see how it interacts. If one was interested in like, there might be easier things to track, but this spread of sustainability attitudes or the spread of concern for nature, in the next 20 years on the field, might we be able to have more granular cross cultural data?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 39:39\n\nYeah, that's definitely the way things are going. There's a proliferation of data sets like the World Values Survey, but the real frontier is, well I think, getting data from social media and online sources, and then figuring out how to analyse it using natural language processing. What my lab's working on is trying to measure aspects of psychology, so things like analytic thinking, or tightness and looseness, inclinations towards individualism, impersonal cooperation, and trying to pry that out of text. So, for example, we have the corpus of US newspapers going back to at least 1840 and we're analysing that to study psychological variation across space and time. And we can also do that in the modern world. So, for example, I'm interested in witchcraft and there's a symbol that appears on Twitter which is an evil eye protection symbol, the nazar, and so we're analysing the appearance and diffusion and increasing frequency of the use of that symbol.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 40:46\n\nAnd there's two parts here, because for me, forgetting even the stages question, the question would be, these kind of memeplexes that there are which comes up, let's say, in more classic stuff, Inglehart and the World Values Survey, we're going to have this crude, good but useful, two dimension, or there's more autonomy or self expression, or the Shalom Schwartz and, you know, these seven factors. But could we get a lot more granular and see that sort of principal components analysis out of like a 50 questionnaire survey? Could we start to see that and see particularly interesting pockets of innovation happening? And then the second point, you're saying, is what's causing that or how they function. What's the causal factors and what causes something to cede or spread? I think that's going back to your first point. There's also these interesting connections between some, maybe, cultural features, it wasn't the intention of it, but the accidental benefit in some other way, like monogamy practices leading to actually growing equality and therefore maybe leading to actually more democracy, which leads to more economic effectiveness or something like that. To take another example from a book I read recently, people are like Burning Man is a nascent micro culture, there are values and norms which are evolving there, which are kind of the frontier of something, you know, it's highly creative. I'm not saying I subscribe to that but it's an example, you might say, how could I work out whether it's really the case that Burning Man has a distinct set of values from the rest of the population, and how is that spreading? How, how do those people when they go there and then they go back to their work, does that transmit? How does it transmit?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 42:42\n\nYeah, I mean, it would be interesting to think about how you could do that with Burning Man, we're getting an increasing ability to do that. A simple example that that reminds me of is there's this paper in economics, I forget the authors, where there ends up being a situation where people get randomly picked to go to the Hajj, and they go to the Hajj and they experienced that and they actually become more cosmopolitan, and more tuned into the global values as a consequence of that experience. And it's a random assignment situation so you can infer causality. So that's a case where we know there's a ritual that has a certain psychological effect, you can imagine something similar with Burning Man, and then people go back to somewhere and then do those ideas spread? Do they have legs in these different kinds of communities? And then you could try to explain why they might have legs in some communities but not others.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 43:38\n\nExactly. Why do they take off? And also there's both the context but also, what's the practice? Another example, for me, would always be like you go to a meditation retreat, it'd be an amazing experience, like, this is really important, but what's the half life? You know, you go back to London or Boston and you're back in your normal life, you're like, oh, it was so important to practice every day, and then you don't, and obviously the huge impact of what's called Sangha or community, are there other people practising with you and how? And particularly for pro social practices, that could be a very important question. So both what's the context, but what other things like if people stay in touch, how does that affect that? What things have we already found, maybe if you summarise a bit for us, you give some examples, where we have been looking at this both development and evolution, there are some examples in your book, The Weirdest People in the World, and where the frontier of that is concrete, things that you would want to look at, maybe start with examples of what you have found?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 44:53\n\nYeah, so my obsession lately has been trying to understand innovation. So, for example, we're working on stuff now, we have a global patent database, which gives us a measure of innovation, at least as captured by patents. So we focus narrowly on Europe and then we say why do some regions of countries have more patents than other parts of countries? And I want to test the ideas developed in the Weirdest People in the World. So what we look at is different parts of, say, Germany spent more centuries under the mediaeval church. And so we're able to connect that to differences in the social structure in terms of the families, and we get that from a different survey. And then we can look at how far people's friendships are based on Facebook data, so that gives us another social measure. And then we can look at aspects of psychology from the European Social Survey, which asked people about trust and fairness and conformity and these kinds of questions. And what we find is that the church affects that, and then those things seem to cash out on more patents. So in places where the church was longer, people are more individualistic, less conformity, more trusting, they have friends that are further away, and they have smaller families, and they produce more patents. And you know, we can compare regions within the same country and hold lots of stuff constant.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 46:18\n\nSo for listeners, let's just walk this through, going back, maybe to start with, the mediaeval church. It's obviously central to your book, the Weirdst People in the World, which I just cannot recommend to listeners enough, really fascinating, of the rise of the West in a way, like a really interesting answer. But to start with, why is the mediaeval church important here? What's the impact of that, you said, on individualism and family structure? Just walk that through briefly and I get that that's going turn out into psychology and then into patenting. But let's start with that.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 46:49\n\nYeah, so the branch of Christianity that eventually leads to the Roman Catholic Church began to adopt a set of unusual practices in the global historical perspective. So they, for example, banned cousin marriage, first to first cousins, but then it eventually goes out to sixth cousins around 1000 CE and contracts back just down to third cousins in 1215. They end polygyny, so the Franks and the Celts and stuff were all polygynous, so they end that. They end concubinage. New inheritance practices; rather than patrilineal inheritance, which was common throughout Europe, they have bilateral inheritance, so you inherit your identity through mom and dad. And so that began spreading throughout Europe and what that effectively does is it begins to dismantle the clans of Europe and breaks them down into monogamous nucular families. And of course, the church spreads kind of semi randomly out from Rome and it goes to England early, but then very late to Scotland and Wales and places like that, so there's these interesting patterns of variation. And so I think that had a big effect on how cultural evolution went in those places, and the development of other kinds of institutions. So when you break the family down, the complex kinship structures of lots of societies, they're not only your personal identity, they're the groups that do production and distribution. They're also the groups that are your legal identity in dealing with laws. And when you break people down to nucular families, you get rid of all that and also a lot of the security that goes along with that; who takes care of you if you're injured or old, that used to be your kin network, and now it's got to be done by something else. So these new institutions around 1000 CE begin emerging in Europe. So think about guilds, which eventually become occupational guilds, monasteries begin proliferating, universities pop up, and charterred towns. So these people would join the towns as citizens, participate in the defence and whatnot, they'd often get some privileges and whatnot, and so these charter towns with certain rights to the individual began diffusing through Europe. So new kinds of institutions you wouldn't have seen otherwise. So like when I was talking about democracy before, this is a case where the church did a bunch of things because they thought that God wanted them to do that, just like in Islam, you can only have four wives and in Zoroastrianism, you should marry relatives, right? So religions have different family policies. But that had these downstream implications for the kinds of other institutions that were likely to emerge. And that then affects people's psychology and, downstream, economic productivity, success and competition against other groups.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 49:30\n\nSo, to summarise, the church had these unusual policies about marriage and family that break down traditional kinship networks and clans. That leads to kind of more individualism, but the consequence is - humans don't function well alone, we need to collaborate with others - instead of the family relationships, we start building more ties outwards. And that leads to more egalitarianism and individualism to these charter towns and so on and so forth. And to finish with the example then is that you have this variable of how long different places in Europe were exposed to the Catholic Church's policies. That cashes out in family structure which cashes out in psychology and behaviours and friendship networks. And that then shows up in, for example, innovation levels. Now, one thing that's kind of negative and positive about this story, I just want to flag again to our policy implication story is, the hard thing about hard things like, this took hundreds or thousands of years, and then has payoffs for hundreds or thousands of years. Often, you know, I was in policy and innovation and so talked to government, they're always like, you know, can't we have a startup fund or something and what we're kind of saying with this is actually, some of the really big things go really deep, and you can't just say we're going to set up a new innovation office, and that's going to lead to more innovation, really, that's one big actual implication of some of this work. But the other way about it, what I hear is, that a long term attitude that supports cultural change can have really, really, really big impacts for a really long time. \n\n**Joe Henrich** 51:34\n\nYeah, so one way of looking at that story is 'well, it doesn't give us much to do in terms of policy, because we can't affect how long the Catholic Church has been around'. But it does tell you, well, what do I need to get innovation? Well, I need free, trusting and cooperative interactions among cognitively diverse minds. How do I get that? Well, it so happens the US bumbled on to that, by having lots of immigration during the 19th century, and one of the other projects is is we look at what leads to innovation in different US counties. And we find counties that have more diverse last names, meaning people from more different kinds of backgrounds, more different families, leads to more innovation coming in the coming decade. So you can think about this as a kind of measure of cultural diversity measured at the family level, and then we're predicting into the future, how many patents you're going to get. And then you know, so the economists will worry, well, we're not sure that's causal, so what we use are these immigration shocks. So there are these tools from economics that allow you to predict whether a county is going to get an immigration shock and that gives us an infusion of last names leading to more cognitive diversity and more innovation. And so anyway, there's this cool relationship between more immigration and more innovation. And something like, you know, Petra Moser's work where she looks at the immigration quotas that were imposed in the US in 1924; that caused immigration to plummet. Prohibition causes immigration to plummet. Now, prohibition is a great case, because you might think, well, alcohol, people are not drinking, maybe they should have better cognitive processes, but turns out ideas meet in saloons and they make baby ideas there. So anyway, so it gives you a bunch of tools, what are we going to do to create the trusting interaction among diverse minds?\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 53:29\n\nRight, and the other aspect that we're having here is also some insight that allows us to create conditions for this. I think one of the learnings from this cultural thing is that individually we're actually quite dumb, what we have is the benefit of this huge cumulative learning that is our culture.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 53:58\n\nYeah, and that's a theme that runs through both The Secret of our Success and The Weirdest People in the World, and it's really the core of the new book I'm working on; individuals, especially if you strip us of all our cultural knowledge, we're really not good at solving problems. When we depend on this big download of tools for thinking and problem solving and framing things and you had mentioned ontology, or like what even exists in the world? Do germs exist, does witchcraft exist? What am I working with here? And then of course, our ability to generate new ideas is mostly the recombination of existing ideas that are all circulating in the cultural milieu. And it's the bringing together of those different ideas that really drive a lot. So you've got to nurture the collective brain. Geniuses and whatnot are much less important than in the popular myth, the myth of the heroic adventure, for example.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 54:53\n\nRight. So basically now we have more knowledge about culture and cultural evolution. While it might take a long time, we can now benefit from that learning and transport stuff. I mean, one example in your book, in The Weirdest People in the World is that this, this might seem negative, but this kind of destruction of traditional kinship networks, which in the long run has its benefits, which China starts doing in 1950s, it's 1950 that I think they ban concubinage, which is polygamy, they start banning, partly in imitation of the West, but the Communist Party did a load of stuff. And the other example, which I'm very close to, because my partner is Taiwanese, you could say the basic Confucian cultural download is quite hierarchical. Classically, if you look at Shalom Schwartz, China would show up as quite hierarchical in the model. But yeah, Taiwan, within a period of 50 years, has become a quite well functioning democracy. This is the point, culture is sticky normally for reasons just because they create institutions, which are equilibriua point, and there's a whole bunch of reasons you can go into as to why it's often hard to change culture. But when it does, because of the way imitation works, it can happen very quickly. So I think the other point is that if we realise that it's culture that we need to shift sometimes, rather than like, we're not going to build a fancy new technology office, it might be like, we need to enable more people to meet in the cafeteria, or we need to have a new attitude to risk taking or something like that; those things can actually move quite quickly, but it's that we do need to be conscious that it's that. If we go and just imitate the layout of Finnish schools, nothing much will happen. But if we imitated the attitude of Finnish teachers or something like that, then we might have a lot of impact.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 56:49\n\nYeah, I think that's a great point; culture is often sticky and inertial, because you have different institutions that sort of interlock. Even if you have the new Burning Man idea about egalitarianism or something that doesn't fit with all the other practices and stuff in the society so it's hard for it to get moving, but if you reorganise things, so that there's not disincentives to adopting or spreading that idea, then things can change quickly, like the Taiwan case; there's lots of cases like that.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 57:19\n\nYes. You've mentioned, while obviously built on the marriage and family programme, the spread of literacy with Protestantism was a very rapid change in the level of reading. So, just to go back, are there other examples? So the marriage and family programme, knowing research stuff, that probably took a lot of thought. And there are other examples that are fascinating in your book, like, the Ilahita tribe. Why I want to mention these is in our day and age today, the challenges that we face, most dramatically the ecological crisis we face, are collective action problems. And you could see one massive aspect of what you call social institutions, but also culture, as having been ways, often because of intergroup competition, to scale cooperation in some way. Could you talk a little bit about maybe the example there, or other examples you've come across, where groups have scaled. And because I mentioned the \\[unintelligable 00:58:31\\], we kind of somehow need to scale a bit globally; we somehow need to have enough identification or connection that we can act on these wicked problems that we face. And obviously societies have done that, you know, and the Ilahita had a wicked problem with a neighbour that was going take them over. Maybe with that example or others, can you talk that through a bit for the audience?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 58:54\n\nYeah, the Ilahita case is interesting, because it's a small scale society of the Arapesh in New Guinea. And anthropologists who had been studying this region thought there was a kind of ecological threshold, ecology was forcing people not to have communities more than about 300 people, or 70 men. So they thought that groups were bumping up against this, but then they found this exceptional village of, depending on how you count, 1500 or 2500, people were living in Iligita and it was the most powerful community in the area, it was very safe from its neighbours, because they had such a large fighting force compared to the other groups. And what had happened there was they had the same system as everybody else, but there was this aggressively expanding group nearby that seemed to have a ritual cult of some kind. And when they copied the cult, they made certain mistakes in which they ended up with communal-wide gods and a communal-wide set of rituals that kind of build bridges between the different clans. And it turns out when these communities split, they split along clan lines. So this structure builds connections between the clans, and helps keep everybody working more harmoniously. And if things start to go bad in the village, people thought that the gods were not happy with them. So they would begin doing the rituals and the rituals are a kind of social technology, which bonds people together and that would re-nurture the bridges between clans and between individuals, and help keep the group together. I use it as a case of institutional evolution, because so much of our institutional evolution is not conscious design. Just to give you one example, people point gto the founding fathers of the US and, of course, a lot of thought went into the Constitution, but they never imagined political parties, or they were against political parties, I should say, they didn't want them to be part of the system. But of course, political parties immediately invaded and have been central to the system. So the system was never designed to have political parties. I mean, that's just an example of an unforeseen consequence. So that's the main point, a lot of my interest has been in how religious ideas foster cooperation and gets spread by this intergroup competition process.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:01:13\n\nWell, of course, just to be clear on religion, again, an area which is often taboo, like, we'll come to the potential dead ends of modernity. If I'm an economist, a lot of stuff is collective action problems, let's call it the most generic version, or private information, like if you really got economic technical about it, like, you're going to do something and I don't know whether you've done it or not. You're going to do my gardening, I don't know how hard you're going to work, or we're going to go fight against the enemy and I don't know if you're going to shirk or not, or all kinds of stuff like that. And, basically, we need some methods of binding cohesion, but also creating internal monitoring; basically ways that you weren't shirk in some way. I'm kind of doing this in nutshell, I'm probably doing  violence for readers who are technical to some of it. And religion obviously plays this central role in doing a whole bunch of things, but obviously, in creating cohesion, but also dealing with with shirking and other types of stuff; you're gonna get punished by the gods, you have examples of taboos in your book, there's many examples. And again, in the Ilahita case, just to flag it, this tribe that grew, let's put it this way, they grew to three or four times the scale that was thought feasible for a group in that area. Can you talk a bit to that? Religion was central there, in what kind of ways, just in that one example?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 1:02:49\n\nYeah. So the big thing they had there was they had these rituals that would allow men to pass through these age sets and the way that was organised was such that it would create interdependence among men from different clans. So it kind of pulled them together and gave them a sense of psychology of interdependence. We know from work in psychology and related fields, that actually performing a ritual together can increase the amount of binding between you. They also began to believe that these gods that were over the entire community, rather than just the usual clan gods, would punish people and they could use that as an explanation for what would otherwise be witchcraft accusations. And oftentimes, clans would split apart and get angry with each other because if someone died, they would think someone from another clan bewitched him. But now an explanation could be given that it was the action of the village gods, this cult that they had. And anyway, so there's a bunch of little factors that work together there to bind people together. One of the other things about religion besides having punishing gods and shared notions of reality and shared aspects of morality, it also has these rituals, which either bind individuals together, or they bind people to their beliefs, they make people believe more strongly in commitments.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:04:17\n\nNow for today we're coming near the end, we've only just really started this discussion. You talk about it in your book, we could think of an evolutionary tree of culture and practices that, in one sense, could allow for scaling. There's competition between groups, and we could think of this in analogy with genetics in a moment, but there's competition between groups and that's going to pressure development along of like, can you get bigger as a society to some extent, because that's a crude way of defending yourself, at least at the beginning, untill you have nuclear weapons or something. So, one of the points I think you make in The Weirdest People is that what was very unusual about what happened in the West was most other societies have kind of gone a kinship route. And then scaling has happened basically via empire, some kinship-knit elite ends up basically controlling a large number of people, because they have exploitive technologies, or slavery or whatever. But what was really unusual about the West in the long run was that we didn't go that route, yet managed to scale. The point was, if I put it this way, just as there are certain evolutionary dead ends in genetics, we can think of things which are highly adapted, but at some point, the problem about them is they're sort of a dead end. There's no way to go forward from there, you know, they are local maxima, if you like, or whatever. Similarly, kinship, like really developing your kinship structure, can be highly effective. But to go back to our point about institutional equilibria, if you're really, really locked into that, it's very hard to change. Right. Why it comes back to this, we can imagine it if we did do another episode, is where are we going today. So let me take a concrete example, which is, to go back to religion - I'm just gonna be provocative here - the West went down a route which, famously in Weber's phrase, once we let the genie out of the bottle with Protestantism, they didn't realise it, but once you have enough free thinking, you're going to come to science, then you come to materialist reductionism and then, in Weber's phrase, the magic has gone out of the world. Everyone predicted in the late 19th century, well the intellectuals, there's going to be a problem coming, because ultimately it's going to destroy religion. And religion is, what you've described, a major thing that binds us. Now, maybe you could say that science in a certain way is a religion, or there are certain other faiths, but they're very thin faiths, in a way, compared to the other faiths. So one example, I'm just being provocative is, are we in something of a dead end, at the moment, where individualism, which has been fantastic and hugely valuable in lots of ways, I'm at least gonna say, but there are limits like, you know, when they have lots of externalities, there are problems in individualism. And similarly, scientific materialism, which has been hugely productive in many ways, taken to where it is, paints us in to a dead end, and it takes us away from the magic of the world. So I'm just asking this question, maybe we could talk to that particular point, but in a more general question that if we were to have a follow up, if we were starting to paint this, like evolutionary tree, for example, of organisational structures that allow us to scale and solve collective action problems, and we have bad need of that today, where are we? To go back to my question, even of studying little groups with Facebook data of where new stuff is popping up, where is the equivalent of like, you know, Martin Luther, or even the Catholic Church in 50 AD? Where are these? What are our dead ends we feel today? And sometimes our dead ends are actually the most evolved thing because they've exhausted themselves. Where are the other places on our cultural evolutionary tree that are most exciting? Maybe we can't even predict, we don't have that capacity yet. But we at least have the ability to notice when they are happening. Yeah, any comments on that? And I said, maybe at this point, we're at the end of the episode. This is something we might come to you if we had a follow up. But any just immediate thoughts on that?\n\n**Joe Henrich** 1:08:16\n\nYeah. Well, I just wanted to re describe what you were saying because I think it's a really important point, which is that, in The Weirdest People in the World, I make the case that most societies got complex and larger by building on the notion of kinship intensity, or these complex kinship units, where eventually you have an elite, which is, you know, emperors and lineage, and they're stratified so there's all these other farmers and whatnot, that formed the lower half. And what happened, not intentionally but unintentionally, due to the church's marriage and family programme, Europe gets knocked down and you know, dark ages or whatever, and then it wouldn't rebuild itself, it's going up a different peak that can go higher, at least in terms of economic production. The first one is, in some sense, easier to access, because we are primates, and we have a kin psychology, and we have a bunch of elements of human nature, which makes that one easy to hit. The church puts those away by making taboos against them and that forces it up this other peak. The chances that that's the best of all possible peaks is quite low, right, just as a statistical matter, the second peak we found. So just in kinds of thinking about a broad cultural evolutionary canvas, there must be other recombinations of cultural institutions and ways of thinking that can lead to even greater prosperity or greater happiness, or all the kinds of good things, greater human flourishing. Now, where and what that's going to look like is harder to imagine because I always say that cultural evolution is smarter than we are. But the place to look would be novel recombinations. Right. So we can see some of these around; what's going on in China, it's a recombination of Western capitalism and some other Western institutions, universities, plus a lot of older Chinese statecraft and Chinese institutions. So that's a new recombination. Japan has a new recombination and we're gonna see new recombinations appear in Africa and the Middle East and so we don't know whether those are going to be great pathways or whether they're going to lead to more human flourishing, but they're experiments that are in process all around the globe.\n\n**Rufus Pollock** 1:10:27\n\nWow. I think that's a great point to end on. So thank you very, very much and, listeners, I hope you will tune in if we have a follow up. Thank you so much, Professor Henrich.\n\n**Joe Henrich** 1:10:38\n\nOkay, great to be with you.

He has had a unique career in many ways, because his trajectory has taken him across, as actually being a tenured professor, across multiple disciplines; in anthropology, in economics, in psychology, and human evolutionary biology. It's an absolute privilege to have you on the show, Joe, thank you so much for joining us. And I wonder if we could just start by you telling us a little bit about that unique career trajectory? Like what what got you interested in this? What motivated you and what was your kind of path a little bit?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 01:01\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so first, it's good to be with you. So when I was an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame, I went to study aerospace engineering. And in my first year, I took a course in anthropology. And I was interested in it, but I wasn't ready to give up the engineering. So I was fortunate that Notre Dame had a dual degree programme where you could get a degree in arts and sciences, or arts and letters, and then a degree in engineering. So I have a BA and a BS undergraduate degree, it took five years, but that allowed me to study both anthropology and engineering. I went and did engineering for a few years, working at an undisclosed location in Northern Virginia, and while I was doing that, I was thinking, well, do I want to continue on this path and maybe consider graduate school - I wanted to study space propulsion - or, you know, explore anthropology more and go into that. And so after two years of doing engineering, I quit and moved to California and enrolled in an anthropology programme at UCLA. And then, you know, I wanted to do a science of culture, a science of anthropology. And the professor that I started working with, he had done that too, although it wasn't very fashionable at the time. And as I was working there, I began reading more widely and bringing in tools from other disciplines and just kind of pursuing that. And then I found another professor at UCLA called Robert Boyd and Boyd had kind of been working, you know, he hadn't had students and he was working very much alone, building mathematical models of cultural evolution. So I got really interested in that, and really went from there trying to build an empirical programme around some of the mathematical models that Boyd and his collaborator Pete Richerson had built.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 02:49\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We'll come to other things. So this is fascinating. I mean, just an aside for me. And I'm gonna interject like I, when I got in, I was an economist for a while, I was interested in the kind of evolution of knowledge and knowledge kind of production in a more formal economic sense. But then I had also come from a mathematical background, I'd studied math, originally. And I got into like branching processes and stuff like that. So I just kind of like, take me back to that part, which you said he kind of had no students, like, why was this? This was kind of rare in anthropology, right, at the time?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 03:20\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, it was. I mean, this is all public knowledge, I think. UCLA wanted to hire Rob's wife, whose name is Joan Silk, and she's now a renowned primatologist. So it was a very smart hire. But he was a spousal hire that was kind of trailing along. He doesn't have a degree in anthropology. He has a PhD in ecology and an undergraduate in physics. And so he gets hired as the spousal hire. And he's just building these mathematical models, which seems very odd and foreign to all anthropologists, including the people at UCLA. He did work with one guy named Bob Unger, but he wasn't technically his advisor. So I was really his first, you know, advisee-type student. But then, for whatever reason, two years after I kind of showed up on the scene, he brought in two other new students. And then we very quickly began working together. And Richard McElreath, who was my friend from graduate school, is now director of one of the Max Planck institutes.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 04:18\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah. I also guess what I'm asking is in anthropology, that wasn't common, that approach, which is, I guess, mathematical, and you said, building models of kind of cultural evolution and phylogeny ie what is the kind of tree of of culture. What I would also kind of lead into is, this trajectory that you've then gone on, there has been sort of an explosion in a way in this area. What's driving that and what's kind of cooking, what's evolving? Because, what I would say is very interesting, moments happen obviously, we could kind of almost be a bit meta here, like the evolution of disciplines, just as like cognitive science, which is now kind of a major discipline, which has all these connections, it's partly under psychology, but it brings in other stuff, there are these very fruitful moments when different disciplines come together and something kind of significant and new emerges. Do you feel that kind of thing has been happening over the space of your career in the area you're in?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 05:22\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so certainly over the last two decades or a bit longer, there's been an explosion of the field that we now call 'Cultural Evolution', although it didn't have that name until about 2010. And that has brought together psychologists, linguists, economists, anthropologists, and others scattered from around the social sciences. And, you know, now there's a society and a lot of interest, I think, and a lot of publications in general science journals like Nature Human Behaviour. Now, this traces back to work that really began in the late 1970s, where first Cavalli-Sforza and Mark Feldman got together and they wrote a book called Cultural Transmission and Evolution published in 1981. And meanwhile, Boyd and Richerson also began working, they published their first paper on this in 1976, around the same time that Richard Dawkins begins to put the selfish meme idea out there. So there's some kind of interest going on, you know, culture wars are going on, because there are socio biologists who are trying to explain human behaviour with evolution. And then there's people going, Oh, but what about culture, you know, humans are cultural. And what these guys are doing is they're trying to think very systematically about culture and, you know, build models of it, but then also say, this has to flow within some kind of evolutionary model. So Boyd and Richerson really distil all this in their 1985 book, where they assume we're products of natural selection, we're animals, but we're animals who rely heavily on learning from other people and that we have specialised mechanisms in our heads that allow us to, from a young age, learn language and social norms, and how to use tools, and all those kinds of things that we think of as culture. So it seats culture within a broader evolutionary framework, and then allows us to think systematically about where do ethnic groups come from. Well, let's start with humans as learners, and why would you, why would ethnic groups ever pop up? And you can ask questions at the sociological level.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 07:23\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"I guess one question I'm asking there, just to go back, which is, you know, anthropology had, I mean, anthropology is a young discipline. And I don't know, I don't want to make myself foolish, but you know, we're talking 100 years, obviously, there's much stuff older than that, but we're talking 100, a bit over 100 years. But why, like, there's kind of this subdiscipline again, you know, I'm not an anthropologist, but there's culutural anthropology, but this was kind of like that, this hadn't been such, it would be much more qualitative, right? There's something kind of, there's mathematical models, there's then a tendency to want to go test this, you're describing certain things that have been coming up, part of that might be you're saying is just genetics had got more rigorous and got, and was kind of getting more, you know, The Selfish Gene, the very fact that we had a rich genetics was inspiring the idea of mimetics. But what was it, is it also there's been a revolution in data, because that's one if you were doing was then going out and starting to empirically, like, you know, for me, or you are trying to empirically look at things and for me, like one lease from reading your books was just this kind of idea of like, Oh, you were kind of going through economics to the ultimatum game, you know, are there replicable standardised kind of things would give me kind of cross cultural data that isn't just like, we've got a lot of data, I think it's in the Yale database, we've got a lot of data on like, marriage practices, but it's not kind of, it's not able to be kind of like standardised in a way that's going to allow us to make as good cross cultural analysis. So I guess I'm trying to ask also, what was it that led to the empirical revolution, or allowed these kind of folk ideas become more rigorous?\\xA0\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 08:57\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So I mean, the one key thing, so I started to talk about what I began doing in the 90s. But that was, I was running directly upstream against what was going on in anthropology, because anthropology was becoming less rigorous and less quantitative, and less interested in that kind of stuff. The history is complex in anthropology, but, you know, beginning with Franz Boas who's considered the founder of American anthropology, there was a rich effort to go out into the world and just record, figure out what people are doing, do a lot of in depth ethnography, counting and quantifying was okay, but really you wanted to do a lot of ethnography. The group at Yale with the Human Relations Area Files, George Peter Murdock began, you know, at least quantifying things at the societal level so we could compare different societies and look at different patterns of kinship or language or all these kinds of cool things. So it was quantitative and it stays quantitative up until the 1970s. And then, you know, anthropology begins with a spread of postmodernism, french structuralism, it begins completely rejecting anything quantitative. And really, kind of unwittingly and stupidly, I show up and my advisors are older, right, they're of the pre generation, they're of the generation that was still quantitative. And so, you know, my advisor, my first advisor, not Rob Boyd, a guy named Allen Johnson, had written a book in the 70s called 'Quantification in Cultural Anthropology', which started to talk about how we could use computers and how we can do systematic data collection. But he was really an old dog, and he, you know, the trend in the field was going directly away from him. But, you know, I had an enterprise that I wanted to do and, you know, Boyd and Richerson had all this theory. So I just started picking out tools from other disciplines. So, in addition to harvesting things from behavioural economics, like the ultimatum game, I was also, you know, working with Richard Nisbett, for example, and taking tools from psychology, trying to measure psychological variation around the world. And I was, you know, I didn't know she was going to win a Nobel Prize, but I was reading Elinor Ostrom just because, you know, she was doing interesting work on cooperation and I was learning about public goods games.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 11:13\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, okay. So one interesting thing is this, these kind of like, even a cultural tide within a discipline influence stuff, and there's kind of been a change, whether it's in anthropology, but this is kind of coming together. So maybe just kind of let's step that forward, is that there's this emerging, I guess in the background here, there's an emerging discipline, you're calling it 'cultural evolution'. I like to joke sometimes what happened to culturology, you know, in a way, what happened to the science and the study of culture? I mean, it's not in any discipline, but we want, that seems just to central to humanity, and what, what kind of, so if we kind of looked into that, in your, in your then evolution, you see that happening, the study of cultural evolution, what are some of the building blocks, and first of all maybe just for myself, and it's such an obvious thing, but what do we mean by culture here? I know, this is a kind of chestnut, but just roughly, what are we talking about when we say we're studying culture?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 12:11\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so the core idea is that people learn stuff, right? So culture is information that got in our heads through some kind of learning process, usually a social learning process. And what we're doing when we're building a model of cultural evolution is we're tracking that information in individual minds through time. The evolution, this sort of natural selection, genetic side of it, comes into it, because once we say, well, okay, that's probably an important thing in humans, we can say, well, how might natural selection have shaped us to make us good cultural learners? What kinds of things should we pay attention to? How should we integrate information from different people in an effective adaptive way that allows an individual to better navigate the world? But then once you have a group of individuals, a population doing that, then you get these population-level phenomena. So one of the things you know, economics has got interested in institutions in the last 25 years, but that's really, they came kind of down to that, right? They were trying to solve higher level questions. Cltural evolution had to cobble up to figure out what an institution is; okay, people learn stuff, then we get social norms, and what's an institution, well an institution is a collection of social norms that regulate a certain area like marriage. And then when we put laws on top of that, that's typically what economists think of as institutions, when you have kind of legally regulated rules for interacting.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 13:32\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yes. Okay. What I also want to mark in there is therefore, what you're also mentioning, is that across different disciplines, this thing of the culture, we're kind of, there's a convergence from several directions, economists may be converging down towards that, because it's kind of the base layer, culture. I mean, even below it, and we're going to talk about that, is kind of, you might say, I would call it ontology, maybe we just call it psychology, to not have a fancy term, but what gives our views and values and way of being, who do we conceive ourselves to be, strictly that's psychology, but it's also a bit richer. There's these kind of layers down, there's kind of like, there's the formal institutions, there's kind of the informal, there's, there's then there's psychology, and culture's near the bottom of that. I think you've got quite a broad definition, which is strictly like, it's hard to determine where culture and formal institutions separate because some of the people debate about like, you know, is it culturre or is it institutions, or is it you know, genetic, genetic, you know, kind of inbuilt psychology. And the other direction is kind of building up in what you're saying is that we've been able to get better and better tools in kind of, I don't wanna call it scientific anthropology or science, you know, where we can go upwards of people's beliefs into aggregating that and how that forms institutions.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 14:58\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah. So there's a few other trends going on at this time, which I think are interesting. So, within psychology, there's this older field of cross cultural psychology where they had been kind of using psychological tools in different societies. But for reasons I don't totally understand, it remained relegated to the peripheries of psychology through most of its history. Then, in 1991, Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama published a paper in a lead psychology journal, which really sparks up this field called 'cultural psychology'. And then Dick Nisbett gets in the act and studies the culture of honour. And then the field of cultural psychology really begins to take off. And they don't really know what they're doing with culture and they don't have a very good theory of culture, but they do know that they're finding psychological differences among populations, that previously the field would have said that these weren't expected. And then in economics, Rob Boyd, my advisor who I was telling you about, he's in this MacArthur group with Sam Bowles, Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr and a lot of behavioural economists. And then we begin doing experiments across different societies, and that gets economics, at least a corner of economics, more interested in culture and stuff. And there seems to be a recognition that in order to address the, the rise of the West question, and why some countries are rich, and some countries are poor, maybe at least legal origins might matter? And once you have legal origins, then why did different countries have different legal origins? And then you begin to pull the thread, right?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 16:39\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, you pull the thread. I mean, listen, I mean, this is for me, going back, I mentioned I'm a Zen Buddhist and, you know, so I got intersted because I was interested in happiness research, but also I was a Buddhist, and, you know, you open any econ textbook, and like, the beginning is, you know, economics is about the allocation of scarce resources you know, with unlimited want, this, you know, I literally open a textbook of my 15 year old nephew the other day, and this is it. And I was seeing this as a Buddhist saying, okay, but at least with happiness, crude Buddhism, I'm going to simplify it, but you know, is like, preferences are changeable, you know, your suffering arises because you've got, not because you just got preferences, but you've got cravings. You can transform craving, and that's the path to true liberation. You know, can you imagine, it's kind of like the inverse, that you should spend all your attention as a human being on like, basically, transforming your inner self, rather than trying to acquire things, which is kind of economics, externally to satisfy them. And what's funny is you go into economic literature at this point in the mid 2000s, when I was doing this, and you're like, there are these models called endogenous preferences, which in economics, you'll know, is fancy terminology for like your preferences can change within the system. And they kind of die out in the 70s, traditionally, because they're too complicated, basically, which is unfortunate, like in macro stuff, they lead to like weird equilibria, and so on. And they only get resurrected, actually, by rational addiction, like the Chicago school use a bunch of them in like the 90s and 2000s for rational addiction models of smoking, you know? But it's like, it's in a weird way, this is one of these things which should have been almost existential to the core economics, because once you think culture is significant, you're like, well, what creates culture, what creates being? And you have some of this in [unintelligible - 00:18:30], who's your colleague, but you know, there is this stuff on like, bounded rationality and self control, you know, like, I only have so much - this is big in psychology, like ego mode management - self control, what do I spend it on? But that goes deep, like, should I spend my limited self control, or like working hard to acquire stuff, or work hard meditating, for example, right? If you really ran this, you'd be in a very interesting place of like, what shakes being and how should we we, you know, do that? Yeah.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 19:01\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so I've had this discussion frequently with economists over the years, and the answers have changed, which is, I think, a good thing from my point of view. So, I mean, a good example is Sam Bowles wrote a paper around 1997, which is, it's got endogenous preferences in the title. And it's basically making the case, using lots of different evidence from before that, that humans have endogenous preferences. It's a great paper, but it doesn't go anywhere, right? Or at least, I mean, eventually it turns out to have a big impact but it wasn't like it was on everybody's lips or anything. It didn't have a big immediate impact. I think for the reasons you're suggesting it was a very slow takeoff. People like Nathan Nunn had to get into the development people in there and the economic history people. But whenever I've brought this up and I would start saying things obnoxious to economist like, we know people acquire preferences via cultural learning, I can give you a big pile of evidence to show, so we know preferences are endogenous, why are you assuming they're exogenous? And it was basically the kind of mathematical argument, you said if, if preferences can move around, there's too many parts moving. And we can't, so we're just going to assume this is fixed. And that can't be the right answer.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 20:14\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"That can't be the right answer. And it's sort of kind of profound here. And I mean, I'll give you other practical examples that really touched me. So let's say, you know, let's say you're interested in education policy, and this is one of my favourite examples. Generally, people talk about Finland, as one example, we won't get to debate right now about how well Finland, but certainly, for example, when the first set of cross country assessment came out, which was the OECD PISA stuff, and it came out also, when people didn't know it was a test, which was really important, because once you have a test for a reasonable period of time, it becomes rubbish, unfortunately, because people teach to it. Finland like ace this, you know, it came top or close to the top. And you ask them a question about, well, how can you reproduce the Finnish education system? A lot of our world today will go like, Oh, they have their schools laid out like this, or they have a curriculum like that. But then you say, well, it's actually the culture. For example, if you go and read books, you interview people, they're like, well, you know, we have really high trust of our teachers, also, pupils tend to respect them, or we have a society where being a primary school teacher is the number one desired profession as a woman. And yet, then huge amounts of ink will get, which is kind of, I would say, is a cultural-type explanation. Now, of course, you can influence that by structuring, you know, paying teachers more, but again, they're not actually paying teachers that much more. But it's higher status, it's high prestige, yes. And that's another point, I've actually got a quote, I got it an excerpt from your book. And we should come to that. I think at one point where you say, prestige is a universal amongst cultures. But what is kind of given prestige, what gives you to acquire prestige, whether it's growing big yams - I'm paraphrasing your quote - whether it's growing big yams, or being great, is incredibly variable. And given the centrality of that to what we do in the world, is it high prestige to like consume lots of stuff and be really famous? Or is it high prestige to be a really brilliant scientist? Or is it high prestige to look after the environment? You know, we can kind of just see obviously in front of our eyes, the profound impacts, those things are going to have on our society and very major challenges we face from the climate crisis, to education to inequality to you name it. So just kind of going back on that endogenous preferences, the point for listeners is, there's a revolution happening, in a positive way. I would say economics is the dominant discipline of our age, for good or ill. You know, what I mean, is it reflects the kind of, at least for policymakers or the elite, often a way of thinking about the world and a dominant kind of social policy tool, whether it's abused, I, you know, having been an economist who's given advice to government, you know, I'm not, I'm not blaming, you know, economists for all that happens. But there's a really big revolution that you're describing is happening, potentially, and even is bubbling up in things like economics, where this primacy of culture and the primacy of being, the amount of evidence that's there is really becoming massive, and that can have some profound impacts, is what you're saying.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 23:33\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And I mean, I think we should, I mean, economics deserves a hat tip in the sense that I really think in the last 15 years, the field's been very responsive.

I think the point I would just flag to you, is that going to this point about endogenous preferences, while it is described as a technical barrier, just to go back to like, what would a Buddhist economics look like? There's something kind of baked in, you know, if you go back to Pareto, you know, who weirdly I read about in a sociological survey by Raymond Aron of sociologists like Durkheim and [unintelligible - 00:24:19], there's something quite deep in the economic way of seeing the world that goes back even to kind of early modernity that's under threat if you take this model seriously. If you take culture and ontology and psychology really seriously. I'll just take one other example here that comes from Buddhism: my preference is not fixed, but also knowing what I really want is hard. And therefore, we live in a society today, I'll just point out, where basically the two things that underpin our most good, summum bonum, which is consumption in the free market and voting and democracy, are both based on the assumption that people know what they want. Now, of course, economists are kind of knocking at the door, you know, Fishing for Fools is written by two Nobel Prize winners, they were economists, but the challenge has always been that really calls into question some profound things about Western society if you keep running with it, just as, I would in analogy with your book, Protestantism called into question profound norms about the nature of the pre modern world, i.e. where did authority come from, how did you decide about things, you know solo scripture or individualism, which, as you point out, had come from a long history of context.

So and in the sense that individuals as optimizers, you gotta be optimising something and, you know, sometimes in our models of cultural evolution, we think people are very much choosing unconsciously, and they're not weighing costs and benefits in the way suggested by the Standard Model.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 26:35\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yes.

Anthropology as we put it, in my sense, when I went to university was, it wasn't like economics is prestigious, there's massively endowed business schools and so on. We can see a future where maybe, whatever the department you're in, this new science of culture is going to be pretty major and central to our kind of intellectual field. That's kind of a thesis that I think we're exploring here. Could you say what you think the directions that would go in like over the next 10 or 20 years? Or that you might like to see it go in? What do you think are the trends here?

So it's hard to imagine a university ever saying, um, we're creating a Department of Cultural Evolution. I mean, just to give you a sense, so at Harvard, like many places, the quote \"sciences\" are under one dean and one administrative unit, and then other things are in other administrative units. But the field of cultural evolution takes seriously genetic evolution, thinks of humans as a kind of animal studies, epigenetics and how that might affect cultural preferences. And at the same time, is interested in you know, where do ethnic groups come from, how does social stratification emerge, what leads to innovation, all things that you would find in economics and sociology and other kinds of fields like that, also religion. So I'm interested in the origins and evolution of religion or religions, none of which would normally be on with the biologists and physicists, right? So the organisation of the university makes it hard to have a Department of Cultural Evolution. Now you can always have centres and stuff and there are centres. At the Arizona State University, they have the Department of Human Evolution and Social Change, which is actually kind of an experiment, I guess, where they have the anthropologists together with lots of other disciplines. So that's a case. My department, human evolutionary biology, we sit with the physicists and the biologists, but we do have people who stretch across into these other disciplines like economics. Now, so I'm actually going to a meeting of leading scholars from different disciplines in November, and basically our charge is, that we've given ourselves, is to design a proper and interdisciplinary social science. So for example, a simple question to ask yourself is how would you train a graduate student? You know, and so I, you know, I want them to know how to do ethnography, like I think one of the problems of development economics is that you gotta go there and live among the population to really understand what's going on, but, you know, it's also good to have an instrumental variable or to conduct randomised field trials or all the kinds of things we see in modern economics. So I want all those tools to be available and at the ready for a young student`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 30:09\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"One thing you've just mentioned about the future and what gets in the way, particularly, maybe of this term 'culture' is that it's interdisciplinarity, and particularly, it's not interdisciplinarity in the sciences. It's not like biologists and physicists need to hang out, which is already a challenge, it's that biologists need to hang out with anthropologists. And so there's this kind of structural, a general ossification problem. You know, and I am no longer in academia, but I still collaborate and so on, so I know that. So that's one kind of institutional, cultural thing. Let's say things went well, what are kind of the topics you'd like to see studied or like, what are the kind of gaps that are really interesting? To give a concrete example, it seems that you have examples in your book and maybe you can now give some, where we can study a particular feature, you know, you know it might be the way people are going to prepare manioc for eating. Or they're gonna, you know, avoid pellagra by preparing cornmeal in a certain way, you can mention these from your book. Those are very specific, but then what we could call like, memeplexes in another area, like, maybe marriage and family, the marriage and family programme for your Weirdest People example, or even, like, puritanism or sometimes you say the Western world. So they're these much bigger levels, kind of like whole constellations of values, views, beliefs, practices. And you know, from another area that I come from, people have these kind of grand unified theories, which are in fashion in physics, but not in social sciences, you know, there are like major waves of human cultural development. I don't know if you've heard of teal organisations, have you heard of this term teal organisation? No? So there's a guy called Ken Wilber and spiral dynamics, I don't know, this is a whole different topic, which was kind of interested in human development in a broad sense. And this is like people in Harvard and other places, you also got interested in like lifespan development, you know, how do humans evolve over the lifespan, not just developmental psychology. There's a small population of people who kind of did some quite radical stuff, you know, this, Robert Keegan, who you might have heard of, right, which is people can kind of become self transcending, or Maslow, you know, self transcendence, not just self actualizing, we do have data on this stuff. Then what came up was that there was this argument that people's kind of values could evolve in substantive ways, like, you know, we start out focused on me, that's both as a tiny child, but there's an analogy with cultures, cultures are focused on, you know, the big man or something like that. This is very crude simplification now of anthropological evolutionary history. But there's points, like we, for example, we expand our domain of concern from me, to my tribe, to larger groups, and ultimately to the world and then to all beings, for example. And this kind of background have these grand theories of these kind of cultural stages of humanity. And why this has then showed up and been very influential is - maybe more in the management consulting and this discussion of teal organisations - these people who came up with this grand unified theory, ended up using colours. So there's like red societies, red is like the mafia and like, it's all about the strong man or woman. And there's this kind of spectrum. So modernity in this spectrum is orange. It's all about rationality, it's all about reason, it's all about meritocracy, it's about bureaucracy. And then the next age has been kind of more like egalitarian, post modernism, it's, you know, they have this grand unified theory that these standard kind of things that highly correlate, you know in a principal components analysis, it'd be like these different dimensions of values of use that highly correlate to reduce to a smaller dimensional draft. And the teal phase is the next one. And so there is a highly influential book called Reinventing Organisations, influential in Silicon Valley and other places about, we need organisations that are much flatter, but where people have a lot more autonomy, but they also are responsible, where they can kind of coordinate in different ways. And for me, by the way, reading your work, one of the connections was what was this revolution of puritanism, of the reformation. This did, maybe in this case through a religion or some set of views and values, shape how people could coordinate and organise in a radically different way and much more maybe egalitarian way, much more effective way, because people could self police in their heads a bit, you know, God's watching them and so on all these classic stories about it. So, to kind of come back to the question I was asking you, where are we in the science of this? We have now examples, and maybe you could describe, where we can trace a given practice, and it's maybe phylogeny, or its development, or at least demonstrate, you know, certain practices are culturally transmitted. And then you have an example in your book of the marriage of family programmes and quite big one, and how that influenced. But where are we in, like, you know, one day, are we going to be able to say, wow, you know, we can explain how this, you know, this new whole culture evolved, you know, or there's a new pocket of something really new emerging over here in, you know, in the southwestern United States, where, you know, it's got these different features that have never been seen before, together, of a cultural behaviour.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 36:03\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So, the field, because it focuses on individual learners, at least at the core, an approach like that would be say you're broadly interested in democracy, and you would look at what kinds of cultural beliefs in a population tend to foster the spread of democratic norms, democratic practices, and you could study things like the school committee's vote or how do families operate, do kids have a vote at the dinner table or where they're going to go the next day or something like that. But then, once you begin to get practices like that, the question will be how did those beliefs and practices and institutions, what kinds of things do they attract? Do they make certain other ideas more likely? So for example, one idea that I've toyed with, and it's hard to get good data on it, but the idea that the spread of monogamous marriage may have actually created a milieu that made democracy more likely to spread. And historians have suggested this as well. So that's two unrelated things that you might not normally put together, but because of the way that enforced monogamy alters the marriage pattern for elite men, that might create more equity within families and give women more bargaining power in the household and that may encourage more democracy, right? That's just one kind of hypothesis. But in any case, so we'll be able to say, well, the hope is that we'll be able to say how different practices and beliefs affect each other, thinking about a population and either acquiring or not acquiring these kinds of beliefs. Some ideas, we're going to learn, fit better with aspects of human nature, so they're more readily to get picked up. Maybe there are ideas and practices that don't fit as well with human nature, but are really good for getting people to cooperate, and you need to have a lot of socialisation practices, rituals, other kinds of institutions that help get these hard-to-think practices and ideas into people's heads. So it'll be a kind of complex articulation of psychology, cultural and sort of innate psychology, with all the bits and pieces that form a society, and then thinking about how those bits and pieces fit together. This stuff you were describing with the stages makes me really nervous, because that's not the picture that's emerging; those are made up.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 38:27\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Right, exactly. It's much richer than that, I think. What I guess I would want to ask, which kind of came out of that though, for myself, was when I was asking about the future of the field, one question I guess I would have, is there are things like the World Values Survey, or the European Values Survey. If we had better data, you know I sat there more informally and was like, okay, if one had quite detailed stuff, and you might get it now out of Facebook or things, can you see new norms almost emerging in real time? Just like in genetics, we might say, okay, we haven't seen this gene, this is a new mutation, this is a new thing and we're going to see how it interacts. If one was interested in like, there might be easier things to track, but this spread of sustainability attitudes or the spread of concern for nature, in the next 20 years on the field, might we be able to have more granular cross cultural data?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 39:39\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, that's definitely the way things are going. There's a proliferation of data sets like the World Values Survey, but the real frontier is, well I think, getting data from social media and online sources, and then figuring out how to analyse it using natural language processing. What my lab's working on is trying to measure aspects of psychology, so things like analytic thinking, or tightness and looseness, inclinations towards individualism, impersonal cooperation, and trying to pry that out of text. So, for example, we have the corpus of US newspapers going back to at least 1840 and we're analysing that to study psychological variation across space and time. And we can also do that in the modern world. So, for example, I'm interested in witchcraft and there's a symbol that appears on Twitter which is an evil eye protection symbol, the nazar, and so we're analysing the appearance and diffusion and increasing frequency of the use of that symbol.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 40:46\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"And there's two parts here, because for me, forgetting even the stages question, the question would be, these kind of memeplexes that there are which comes up, let's say, in more classic stuff, Inglehart and the World Values Survey, we're going to have this crude, good but useful, two dimension, or there's more autonomy or self expression, or the Shalom Schwartz and, you know, these seven factors. But could we get a lot more granular and see that sort of principal components analysis out of like a 50 questionnaire survey? Could we start to see that and see particularly interesting pockets of innovation happening? And then the second point, you're saying, is what's causing that or how they function. What's the causal factors and what causes something to cede or spread? I think that's going back to your first point. There's also these interesting connections between some, maybe, cultural features, it wasn't the intention of it, but the accidental benefit in some other way, like monogamy practices leading to actually growing equality and therefore maybe leading to actually more democracy, which leads to more economic effectiveness or something like that. To take another example from a book I read recently, people are like Burning Man is a nascent micro culture, there are values and norms which are evolving there, which are kind of the frontier of something, you know, it's highly creative. I'm not saying I subscribe to that but it's an example, you might say, how could I work out whether it's really the case that Burning Man has a distinct set of values from the rest of the population, and how is that spreading? How, how do those people when they go there and then they go back to their work, does that transmit? How does it transmit?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 42:42\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, I mean, it would be interesting to think about how you could do that with Burning Man, we're getting an increasing ability to do that. A simple example that that reminds me of is there's this paper in economics, I forget the authors, where there ends up being a situation where people get randomly picked to go to the Hajj, and they go to the Hajj and they experienced that and they actually become more cosmopolitan, and more tuned into the global values as a consequence of that experience. And it's a random assignment situation so you can infer causality. So that's a case where we know there's a ritual that has a certain psychological effect, you can imagine something similar with Burning Man, and then people go back to somewhere and then do those ideas spread? Do they have legs in these different kinds of communities? And then you could try to explain why they might have legs in some communities but not others.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 43:38\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Exactly. Why do they take off? And also there's both the context but also, what's the practice? Another example, for me, would always be like you go to a meditation retreat, it'd be an amazing experience, like, this is really important, but what's the half life? You know, you go back to London or Boston and you're back in your normal life, you're like, oh, it was so important to practice every day, and then you don't, and obviously the huge impact of what's called Sangha or community, are there other people practising with you and how? And particularly for pro social practices, that could be a very important question. So both what's the context, but what other things like if people stay in touch, how does that affect that? What things have we already found, maybe if you summarise a bit for us, you give some examples, where we have been looking at this both development and evolution, there are some examples in your book, The Weirdest People in the World, and where the frontier of that is concrete, things that you would want to look at, maybe start with examples of what you have found?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 44:53\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so my obsession lately has been trying to understand innovation. So, for example, we're working on stuff now, we have a global patent database, which gives us a measure of innovation, at least as captured by patents. So we focus narrowly on Europe and then we say why do some regions of countries have more patents than other parts of countries? And I want to test the ideas developed in the Weirdest People in the World. So what we look at is different parts of, say, Germany spent more centuries under the mediaeval church. And so we're able to connect that to differences in the social structure in terms of the families, and we get that from a different survey. And then we can look at how far people's friendships are based on Facebook data, so that gives us another social measure. And then we can look at aspects of psychology from the European Social Survey, which asked people about trust and fairness and conformity and these kinds of questions. And what we find is that the church affects that, and then those things seem to cash out on more patents. So in places where the church was longer, people are more individualistic, less conformity, more trusting, they have friends that are further away, and they have smaller families, and they produce more patents. And you know, we can compare regions within the same country and hold lots of stuff constant.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 46:18\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So for listeners, let's just walk this through, going back, maybe to start with, the mediaeval church. It's obviously central to your book, the Weirdst People in the World, which I just cannot recommend to listeners enough, really fascinating, of the rise of the West in a way, like a really interesting answer. But to start with, why is the mediaeval church important here? What's the impact of that, you said, on individualism and family structure? Just walk that through briefly and I get that that's going turn out into psychology and then into patenting. But let's start with that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 46:49\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so the branch of Christianity that eventually leads to the Roman Catholic Church began to adopt a set of unusual practices in the global historical perspective. So they, for example, banned cousin marriage, first to first cousins, but then it eventually goes out to sixth cousins around 1000 CE and contracts back just down to third cousins in 1215. They end polygyny, so the Franks and the Celts and stuff were all polygynous, so they end that. They end concubinage. New inheritance practices; rather than patrilineal inheritance, which was common throughout Europe, they have bilateral inheritance, so you inherit your identity through mom and dad. And so that began spreading throughout Europe and what that effectively does is it begins to dismantle the clans of Europe and breaks them down into monogamous nucular families. And of course, the church spreads kind of semi randomly out from Rome and it goes to England early, but then very late to Scotland and Wales and places like that, so there's these interesting patterns of variation. And so I think that had a big effect on how cultural evolution went in those places, and the development of other kinds of institutions. So when you break the family down, the complex kinship structures of lots of societies, they're not only your personal identity, they're the groups that do production and distribution. They're also the groups that are your legal identity in dealing with laws. And when you break people down to nucular families, you get rid of all that and also a lot of the security that goes along with that; who takes care of you if you're injured or old, that used to be your kin network, and now it's got to be done by something else. So these new institutions around 1000 CE begin emerging in Europe. So think about guilds, which eventually become occupational guilds, monasteries begin proliferating, universities pop up, and charterred towns. So these people would join the towns as citizens, participate in the defence and whatnot, they'd often get some privileges and whatnot, and so these charter towns with certain rights to the individual began diffusing through Europe. So new kinds of institutions you wouldn't have seen otherwise. So like when I was talking about democracy before, this is a case where the church did a bunch of things because they thought that God wanted them to do that, just like in Islam, you can only have four wives and in Zoroastrianism, you should marry relatives, right? So religions have different family policies. But that had these downstream implications for the kinds of other institutions that were likely to emerge. And that then affects people's psychology and, downstream, economic productivity, success and competition against other groups.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 49:30\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"So, to summarise, the church had these unusual policies about marriage and family that break down traditional kinship networks and clans. That leads to kind of more individualism, but the consequence is - humans don't function well alone, we need to collaborate with others - instead of the family relationships, we start building more ties outwards. And that leads to more egalitarianism and individualism to these charter towns and so on and so forth. And to finish with the example then is that you have this variable of how long different places in Europe were exposed to the Catholic Church's policies. That cashes out in family structure which cashes out in psychology and behaviours and friendship networks. And that then shows up in, for example, innovation levels. Now, one thing that's kind of negative and positive about this story, I just want to flag again to our policy implication story is, the hard thing about hard things like, this took hundreds or thousands of years, and then has payoffs for hundreds or thousands of years. Often, you know, I was in policy and innovation and so talked to government, they're always like, you know, can't we have a startup fund or something and what we're kind of saying with this is actually, some of the really big things go really deep, and you can't just say we're going to set up a new innovation office, and that's going to lead to more innovation, really, that's one big actual implication of some of this work. But the other way about it, what I hear is, that a long term attitude that supports cultural change can have really, really, really big impacts for a really long time.\\xA0\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 51:34\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah, so one way of looking at that story is 'well, it doesn't give us much to do in terms of policy, because we can't affect how long the Catholic Church has been around'. But it does tell you, well, what do I need to get innovation? Well, I need free, trusting and cooperative interactions among cognitively diverse minds. How do I get that? Well, it so happens the US bumbled on to that, by having lots of immigration during the 19th century, and one of the other projects is is we look at what leads to innovation in different US counties. And we find counties that have more diverse last names, meaning people from more different kinds of backgrounds, more different families, leads to more innovation coming in the coming decade. So you can think about this as a kind of measure of cultural diversity measured at the family level, and then we're predicting into the future, how many patents you're going to get. And then you know, so the economists will worry, well, we're not sure that's causal, so what we use are these immigration shocks. So there are these tools from economics that allow you to predict whether a county is going to get an immigration shock and that gives us an infusion of last names leading to more cognitive diversity and more innovation. And so anyway, there's this cool relationship between more immigration and more innovation. And something like, you know, Petra Moser's work where she looks at the immigration quotas that were imposed in the US in 1924; that caused immigration to plummet. Prohibition causes immigration to plummet. Now, prohibition is a great case, because you might think, well, alcohol, people are not drinking, maybe they should have better cognitive processes, but turns out ideas meet in saloons and they make baby ideas there. So anyway, so it gives you a bunch of tools, what are we going to do to create the trusting interaction among diverse minds?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 53:29\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Right, and the other aspect that we're having here is also some insight that allows us to create conditions for this.

When we depend on this big download of tools for thinking and problem solving and framing things and you had mentioned ontology, or like what even exists in the world? Do germs exist, does witchcraft exist? What am I working with here? And then of course, our ability to generate new ideas is mostly the recombination of existing ideas that are all circulating in the cultural milieu. And it's the bringing together of those different ideas that really drive a lot. So you've got to nurture the collective brain. Geniuses and whatnot are much less important than in the popular myth, the myth of the heroic adventure, for example.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 54:53\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Right. So basically now we have more knowledge about culture and cultural evolution. While it might take a long time, we can now benefit from that learning and transport stuff. I mean, one example in your book, in The Weirdest People in the World is that this, this might seem negative, but this kind of destruction of traditional kinship networks, which in the long run has its benefits, which China starts doing in 1950s, it's 1950 that I think they ban concubinage, which is polygamy, they start banning, partly in imitation of the West, but the Communist Party did a load of stuff. And the other example, which I'm very close to, because my partner is Taiwanese, you could say the basic Confucian cultural download is quite hierarchical. Classically, if you look at Shalom Schwartz, China would show up as quite hierarchical in the model. But yeah, Taiwan, within a period of 50 years, has become a quite well functioning democracy. This is the point, culture is sticky normally for reasons just because they create institutions, which are equilibriua point, and there's a whole bunch of reasons you can go into as to why it's often hard to change culture. But when it does, because of the way imitation works, it can happen very quickly. So I think the other point is that if we realise that it's culture that we need to shift sometimes, rather than like, we're not going to build a fancy new technology office, it might be like, we need to enable more people to meet in the cafeteria, or we need to have a new attitude to risk taking or something like that; those things can actually move quite quickly, but it's that we do need to be conscious that it's that. If we go and just imitate the layout of Finnish schools, nothing much will happen.

Even if you have the new Burning Man idea about egalitarianism or something that doesn't fit with all the other practices and stuff in the society so it's hard for it to get moving, but if you reorganise things, so that there's not disincentives to adopting or spreading that idea, then things can change quickly, like the Taiwan case; there's lots of cases like that.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 57:19\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yes.

So, just to go back, are there other examples? So the marriage and family programme, knowing research stuff, that probably took a lot of thought. And there are other examples that are fascinating in your book, like, the Ilahita tribe. Why I want to mention these is in our day and age today, the challenges that we face, most dramatically the ecological crisis we face, are collective action problems. And you could see one massive aspect of what you call social institutions, but also culture, as having been ways, often because of intergroup competition, to scale cooperation in some way. Could you talk a little bit about maybe the example there, or other examples you've come across, where groups have scaled. And because I mentioned the [unintelligable 00:58:31], we kind of somehow need to scale a bit globally; we somehow need to have enough identification or connection that we can act on these wicked problems that we face. And obviously societies have done that, you know, and the Ilahita had a wicked problem with a neighbour that was going take them over.

And anthropologists who had been studying this region thought there was a kind of ecological threshold, ecology was forcing people not to have communities more than about 300 people, or 70 men. So they thought that groups were bumping up against this, but then they found this exceptional village of, depending on how you count, 1500 or 2500, people were living in Iligita and it was the most powerful community in the area, it was very safe from its neighbours, because they had such a large fighting force compared to the other groups. And what had happened there was they had the same system as everybody else, but there was this aggressively expanding group nearby that seemed to have a ritual cult of some kind. And when they copied the cult, they made certain mistakes in which they ended up with communal-wide gods and a communal-wide set of rituals that kind of build bridges between the different clans. And it turns out when these communities split, they split along clan lines. So this structure builds connections between the clans, and helps keep everybody working more harmoniously. And if things start to go bad in the village, people thought that the gods were not happy with them. So they would begin doing the rituals and the rituals are a kind of social technology, which bonds people together and that would re-nurture the bridges between clans and between individuals, and help keep the group together. I use it as a case of institutional evolution, because so much of our institutional evolution is not conscious design. Just to give you one example, people point gto the founding fathers of the US and, of course, a lot of thought went into the Constitution, but they never imagined political parties, or they were against political parties, I should say, they didn't want them to be part of the system. But of course, political parties immediately invaded and have been central to the system. So the system was never designed to have political parties. I mean, that's just an example of an unforeseen consequence.

And religion obviously plays this central role in doing a whole bunch of things, but obviously, in creating cohesion, but also dealing with with shirking and other types of stuff; you're gonna get punished by the gods, you have examples of taboos in your book, there's many examples. And again, in the Ilahita case, just to flag it, this tribe that grew, let's put it this way, they grew to three or four times the scale that was thought feasible for a group in that area. Can you talk a bit to that? Religion was central there, in what kind of ways, just in that one example?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 1:02:49\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah. So the big thing they had there was they had these rituals that would allow men to pass through these age sets and the way that was organised was such that it would create interdependence among men from different clans. So it kind of pulled them together and gave them a sense of psychology of interdependence. We know from work in psychology and related fields, that actually performing a ritual together can increase the amount of binding between you. They also began to believe that these gods that were over the entire community, rather than just the usual clan gods, would punish people and they could use that as an explanation for what would otherwise be witchcraft accusations. And oftentimes, clans would split apart and get angry with each other because if someone died, they would think someone from another clan bewitched him. But now an explanation could be given that it was the action of the village gods, this cult that they had. And anyway, so there's a bunch of little factors that work together there to bind people together. One of the other things about religion besides having punishing gods and shared notions of reality and shared aspects of morality, it also has these rituals, which either bind individuals together, or they bind people to their beliefs, they make people believe more strongly in commitments.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:04:17\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Now for today we're coming near the end, we've only just really started this discussion. You talk about it in your book, we could think of an evolutionary tree of culture and practices that, in one sense, could allow for scaling. There's competition between groups, and we could think of this in analogy with genetics in a moment, but there's competition between groups and that's going to pressure development along of like, can you get bigger as a society to some extent, because that's a crude way of defending yourself, at least at the beginning, untill you have nuclear weapons or something. So, one of the points I think you make in The Weirdest People is that what was very unusual about what happened in the West was most other societies have kind of gone a kinship route. And then scaling has happened basically via empire, some kinship-knit elite ends up basically controlling a large number of people, because they have exploitive technologies, or slavery or whatever. But what was really unusual about the West in the long run was that we didn't go that route, yet managed to scale. The point was, if I put it this way, just as there are certain evolutionary dead ends in genetics, we can think of things which are highly adapted, but at some point, the problem about them is they're sort of a dead end. There's no way to go forward from there, you know, they are local maxima, if you like, or whatever. Similarly, kinship, like really developing your kinship structure, can be highly effective. But to go back to our point about institutional equilibria, if you're really, really locked into that, it's very hard to change. Right. Why it comes back to this, we can imagine it if we did do another episode, is where are we going today. So let me take a concrete example, which is, to go back to religion - I'm just gonna be provocative here - the West went down a route which, famously in Weber's phrase, once we let the genie out of the bottle with Protestantism, they didn't realise it, but once you have enough free thinking, you're going to come to science, then you come to materialist reductionism and then, in Weber's phrase, the magic has gone out of the world. Everyone predicted in the late 19th century, well the intellectuals, there's going to be a problem coming, because ultimately it's going to destroy religion. And religion is, what you've described, a major thing that binds us. Now, maybe you could say that science in a certain way is a religion, or there are certain other faiths, but they're very thin faiths, in a way, compared to the other faiths. So one example, I'm just being provocative is, are we in something of a dead end, at the moment, where individualism, which has been fantastic and hugely valuable in lots of ways, I'm at least gonna say, but there are limits like, you know, when they have lots of externalities, there are problems in individualism. And similarly, scientific materialism, which has been hugely productive in many ways, taken to where it is, paints us in to a dead end, and it takes us away from the magic of the world. So I'm just asking this question, maybe we could talk to that particular point, but in a more general question that if we were to have a follow up, if we were starting to paint this, like evolutionary tree, for example, of organisational structures that allow us to scale and solve collective action problems, and we have bad need of that today, where are we? To go back to my question, even of studying little groups with Facebook data of where new stuff is popping up, where is the equivalent of like, you know, Martin Luther, or even the Catholic Church in 50 AD? Where are these? What are our dead ends we feel today? And sometimes our dead ends are actually the most evolved thing because they've exhausted themselves. Where are the other places on our cultural evolutionary tree that are most exciting? Maybe we can't even predict, we don't have that capacity yet. But we at least have the ability to notice when they are happening. Yeah, any comments on that? And I said, maybe at this point, we're at the end of the episode. This is something we might come to you if we had a follow up. But any just immediate thoughts on that?\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Joe Henrich\"}),\" 1:08:16\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Yeah. Well, I just wanted to re describe what you were saying because I think it's a really important point, which is that, in The Weirdest People in the World, I make the case that most societies got complex and larger by building on the notion of kinship intensity, or these complex kinship units, where eventually you have an elite, which is, you know, emperors and lineage, and they're stratified so there's all these other farmers and whatnot, that formed the lower half. And what happened, not intentionally but unintentionally, due to the church's marriage and family programme, Europe gets knocked down and you know, dark ages or whatever, and then it wouldn't rebuild itself, it's going up a different peak that can go higher, at least in terms of economic production. The first one is, in some sense, easier to access, because we are primates, and we have a kin psychology, and we have a bunch of elements of human nature, which makes that one easy to hit. The church puts those away by making taboos against them and that forces it up this other peak. The chances that that's the best of all possible peaks is quite low, right, just as a statistical matter, the second peak we found. So just in kinds of thinking about a broad cultural evolutionary canvas, there must be other recombinations of cultural institutions and ways of thinking that can lead to even greater prosperity or greater happiness, or all the kinds of good things, greater human flourishing. Now, where and what that's going to look like is harder to imagine because I always say that cultural evolution is smarter than we are. But the place to look would be novel recombinations. Right. So we can see some of these around; what's going on in China, it's a recombination of Western capitalism and some other Western institutions, universities, plus a lot of older Chinese statecraft and Chinese institutions. So that's a new recombination. Japan has a new recombination and we're gonna see new recombinations appear in Africa and the Middle East and so we don't know whether those are going to be great pathways or whether they're going to lead to more human flourishing, but they're experiments that are in process all around the globe.\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"Rufus Pollock\"}),\" 1:10:27\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Wow.

I have the privilege today of being joined by Professor Joe Henrich. He is the Ruth Moore Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. And he is the author of several books, most recently, two widely read popular books, The Weirdest People in the World, and The Secret of Our Success. He has had a unique career in many ways, because his trajectory has taken him across, as actually being a tenured professor, across multiple disciplines; in anthropology, in economics, in psychology, and human evolutionary biology. It's an absolute privilege to have you on the show, Joe, thank you so much for joining us. And I wonder if we could just start by you telling us a little bit about that unique career trajectory? Like what what got you interested in this? What motivated you and what was your kind of path a little bit?\n\nJoe Henrich 01:01\n\nYeah, so first, it's good to be with you. So when I was an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame, I went to study aerospace engineering. And in my first year, I took a course in anthropology. And I was interested in it, but I wasn't ready to give up the engineering. So I was fortunate that Notre Dame had a dual degree programme where you could get a degree in arts and sciences, or arts and letters, and then a degree in engineering. So I have a BA and a BS undergraduate degree, it took five years, but that allowed me to study both anthropology and engineering. I went and did engineering for a few years, working at an undisclosed location in Northern Virginia, and while I was doing that, I was thinking, well, do I want to continue on this path and maybe consider graduate school - I wanted to study space propulsion - or, you know, explore anthropology more and go into that. And so after two years of doing engineering, I quit and moved to California and enrolled in an anthropology programme at UCLA. And then, you know, I wanted to do a science of culture, a science of anthropology. And the professor that I started working with, he had done that too, although it wasn't very fashionable at the time. And as I was working there, I began reading more widely and bringing in tools from other disciplines and just kind of pursuing that. And then I found another professor at UCLA called Robert Boyd and Boyd had kind of been working, you know, he hadn't had students and he was working very much alone, building mathematical models of cultural evolution. So I got really interested in that, and really went from there trying to build an empirical programme around some of the mathematical models that Boyd and his collaborator Pete Richerson had built.\n\nRufus Pollock 02:49\n\nWe'll come to other things. So this is fascinating. I mean, just an aside for me. And I'm gonna interject like I, when I got in, I was an economist for a while, I was interested in the kind of evolution of knowledge and knowledge kind of production in a more formal economic sense. But then I had also come from a mathematical background, I'd studied math, originally. And I got into like branching processes and stuff like that. So I just kind of like, take me back to that part, which you said he kind of had no students, like, why was this? This was kind of rare in anthropology, right, at the time?\n\nJoe Henrich 03:20\n\nYeah, it was. I mean, this is all public knowledge, I think. UCLA wanted to hire Rob's wife, whose name is Joan Silk, and she's now a renowned primatologist. So it was a very smart hire. But he was a spousal hire that was kind of trailing along. He doesn't have a degree in anthropology. He has a PhD in ecology and an undergraduate in physics. And so he gets hired as the spousal hire. And he's just building these mathematical models, which seems very odd and foreign to all anthropologists, including the people at UCLA. He did work with one guy named Bob Unger, but he wasn't technically his advisor. So I was really his first, you know, advisee-type student. But then, for whatever reason, two years after I kind of showed up on the scene, he brought in two other new students. And then we very quickly began working together. And Richard McElreath, who was my friend from graduate school, is now director of one of the Max Planck institutes.\n\nRufus Pollock 04:18\n\nYeah. I also guess what I'm asking is in anthropology, that wasn't common, that approach, which is, I guess, mathematical, and you said, building models of kind of cultural evolution and phylogeny ie what is the kind of tree of of culture. What I would also kind of lead into is, this trajectory that you've then gone on, there has been sort of an explosion in a way in this area. What's driving that and what's kind of cooking, what's evolving? Because, what I would say is very interesting, moments happen obviously, we could kind of almost be a bit meta here, like the evolution of disciplines, just as like cognitive science, which is now kind of a major discipline, which has all these connections, it's partly under psychology, but it brings in other stuff, there are these very fruitful moments when different disciplines come together and something kind of significant and new emerges. Do you feel that kind of thing has been happening over the space of your career in the area you're in?\n\nJoe Henrich 05:22\n\nYeah, so certainly over the last two decades or a bit longer, there's been an explosion of the field that we now call 'Cultural Evolution', although it didn't have that name until about 2010. And that has brought together psychologists, linguists, economists, anthropologists, and others scattered from around the social sciences. And, you know, now there's a society and a lot of interest, I think, and a lot of publications in general science journals like Nature Human Behaviour. Now, this traces back to work that really began in the late 1970s, where first Cavalli-Sforza and Mark Feldman got together and they wrote a book called Cultural Transmission and Evolution published in 1981. And meanwhile, Boyd and Richerson also began working, they published their first paper on this in 1976, around the same time that Richard Dawkins begins to put the selfish meme idea out there. So there's some kind of interest going on, you know, culture wars are going on, because there are socio biologists who are trying to explain human behaviour with evolution. And then there's people going, Oh, but what about culture, you know, humans are cultural. And what these guys are doing is they're trying to think very systematically about culture and, you know, build models of it, but then also say, this has to flow within some kind of evolutionary model. So Boyd and Richerson really distil all this in their 1985 book, where they assume we're products of natural selection, we're animals, but we're animals who rely heavily on learning from other people and that we have specialised mechanisms in our heads that allow us to, from a young age, learn language and social norms, and how to use tools, and all those kinds of things that we think of as culture. So it seats culture within a broader evolutionary framework, and then allows us to think systematically about where do ethnic groups come from. Well, let's start with humans as learners, and why would you, why would ethnic groups ever pop up? And you can ask questions at the sociological level.\n\nRufus Pollock 07:23\n\nI guess one question I'm asking there, just to go back, which is, you know, anthropology had, I mean, anthropology is a young discipline. And I don't know, I don't want to make myself foolish, but you know, we're talking 100 years, obviously, there's much stuff older than that, but we're talking 100, a bit over 100 years. But why, like, there's kind of this subdiscipline again, you know, I'm not an anthropologist, but there's culutural anthropology, but this was kind of like that, this hadn't been such, it would be much more qualitative, right? There's something kind of, there's mathematical models, there's then a tendency to want to go test this, you're describing certain things that have been coming up, part of that might be you're saying is just genetics had got more rigorous and got, and was kind of getting more, you know, The Selfish Gene, the very fact that we had a rich genetics was inspiring the idea of mimetics. But what was it, is it also there's been a revolution in data, because that's one if you were doing was then going out and starting to empirically, like, you know, for me, or you are trying to empirically look at things and for me, like one lease from reading your books was just this kind of idea of like, Oh, you were kind of going through economics to the ultimatum game, you know, are there replicable standardised kind of things would give me kind of cross cultural data that isn't just like, we've got a lot of data, I think it's in the Yale database, we've got a lot of data on like, marriage practices, but it's not kind of, it's not able to be kind of like standardised in a way that's going to allow us to make as good cross cultural analysis. So I guess I'm trying to ask also, what was it that led to the empirical revolution, or allowed these kind of folk ideas become more rigorous? \n\nJoe Henrich 08:57\n\nSo I mean, the one key thing, so I started to talk about what I began doing in the 90s. But that was, I was running directly upstream against what was going on in anthropology, because anthropology was becoming less rigorous and less quantitative, and less interested in that kind of stuff. The history is complex in anthropology, but, you know, beginning with Franz Boas who's considered the founder of American anthropology, there was a rich effort to go out into the world and just record, figure out what people are doing, do a lot of in depth ethnography, counting and quantifying was okay, but really you wanted to do a lot of ethnography. The group at Yale with the Human Relations Area Files, George Peter Murdock began, you know, at least quantifying things at the societal level so we could compare different societies and look at different patterns of kinship or language or all these kinds of cool things. So it was quantitative and it stays quantitative up until the 1970s. And then, you know, anthropology begins with a spread of postmodernism, french structuralism, it begins completely rejecting anything quantitative. And really, kind of unwittingly and stupidly, I show up and my advisors are older, right, they're of the pre generation, they're of the generation that was still quantitative. And so, you know, my advisor, my first advisor, not Rob Boyd, a guy named Allen Johnson, had written a book in the 70s called 'Quantification in Cultural Anthropology', which started to talk about how we could use computers and how we can do systematic data collection. But he was really an old dog, and he, you know, the trend in the field was going directly away from him. But, you know, I had an enterprise that I wanted to do and, you know, Boyd and Richerson had all this theory. So I just started picking out tools from other disciplines. So, in addition to harvesting things from behavioural economics, like the ultimatum game, I was also, you know, working with Richard Nisbett, for example, and taking tools from psychology, trying to measure psychological variation around the world. And I was, you know, I didn't know she was going to win a Nobel Prize, but I was reading Elinor Ostrom just because, you know, she was doing interesting work on cooperation and I was learning about public goods games.\n\nRufus Pollock 11:13\n\nYeah, okay. So one interesting thing is this, these kind of like, even a cultural tide within a discipline influence stuff, and there's kind of been a change, whether it's in anthropology, but this is kind of coming together. So maybe just kind of let's step that forward, is that there's this emerging, I guess in the background here, there's an emerging discipline, you're calling it 'cultural evolution'. I like to joke sometimes what happened to culturology, you know, in a way, what happened to the science and the study of culture? I mean, it's not in any discipline, but we want, that seems just to central to humanity, and what, what kind of, so if we kind of looked into that, in your, in your then evolution, you see that happening, the study of cultural evolution, what are some of the building blocks, and first of all maybe just for myself, and it's such an obvious thing, but what do we mean by culture here? I know, this is a kind of chestnut, but just roughly, what are we talking about when we say we're studying culture?\n\nJoe Henrich 12:11\n\nYeah, so the core idea is that people learn stuff, right? So culture is information that got in our heads through some kind of learning process, usually a social learning process. And what we're doing when we're building a model of cultural evolution is we're tracking that information in individual minds through time. The evolution, this sort of natural selection, genetic side of it, comes into it, because once we say, well, okay, that's probably an important thing in humans, we can say, well, how might natural selection have shaped us to make us good cultural learners? What kinds of things should we pay attention to? How should we integrate information from different people in an effective adaptive way that allows an individual to better navigate the world? But then once you have a group of individuals, a population doing that, then you get these population-level phenomena. So one of the things you know, economics has got interested in institutions in the last 25 years, but that's really, they came kind of down to that, right? They were trying to solve higher level questions. Cltural evolution had to cobble up to figure out what an institution is; okay, people learn stuff, then we get social norms, and what's an institution, well an institution is a collection of social norms that regulate a certain area like marriage. And then when we put laws on top of that, that's typically what economists think of as institutions, when you have kind of legally regulated rules for interacting.\n\nRufus Pollock 13:32\n\nYes. Okay. What I also want to mark in there is therefore, what you're also mentioning, is that across different disciplines, this thing of the culture, we're kind of, there's a convergence from several directions, economists may be converging down towards that, because it's kind of the base layer, culture. I mean, even below it, and we're going to talk about that, is kind of, you might say, I would call it ontology, maybe we just call it psychology, to not have a fancy term, but what gives our views and values and way of being, who do we conceive ourselves to be, strictly that's psychology, but it's also a bit richer. There's these kind of layers down, there's kind of like, there's the formal institutions, there's kind of the informal, there's, there's then there's psychology, and culture's near the bottom of that. I think you've got quite a broad definition, which is strictly like, it's hard to determine where culture and formal institutions separate because some of the people debate about like, you know, is it culturre or is it institutions, or is it you know, genetic, genetic, you know, kind of inbuilt psychology. And the other direction is kind of building up in what you're saying is that we've been able to get better and better tools in kind of, I don't wanna call it scientific anthropology or science, you know, where we can go upwards of people's beliefs into aggregating that and how that forms institutions.\n\nJoe Henrich 14:58\n\nYeah. So there's a few other trends going on at this time, which I think are interesting. So, within psychology, there's this older field of cross cultural psychology where they had been kind of using psychological tools in different societies. But for reasons I don't totally understand, it remained relegated to the peripheries of psychology through most of its history. Then, in 1991, Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama published a paper in a lead psychology journal, which really sparks up this field called 'cultural psychology'. And then Dick Nisbett gets in the act and studies the culture of honour. And then the field of cultural psychology really begins to take off. And they don't really know what they're doing with culture and they don't have a very good theory of culture, but they do know that they're finding psychological differences among populations, that previously the field would have said that these weren't expected. And then in economics, Rob Boyd, my advisor who I was telling you about, he's in this MacArthur group with Sam Bowles, Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr and a lot of behavioural economists. And then we begin doing experiments across different societies, and that gets economics, at least a corner of economics, more interested in culture and stuff. And there seems to be a recognition that in order to address the, the rise of the West question, and why some countries are rich, and some countries are poor, maybe at least legal origins might matter? And once you have legal origins, then why did different countries have different legal origins? And then you begin to pull the thread, right?\n\nRufus Pollock 16:39\n\nYeah, you pull the thread. I mean, listen, I mean, this is for me, going back, I mentioned I'm a Zen Buddhist and, you know, so I got intersted because I was interested in happiness research, but also I was a Buddhist, and, you know, you open any econ textbook, and like, the beginning is, you know, economics is about the allocation of scarce resources you know, with unlimited want, this, you know, I literally open a textbook of my 15 year old nephew the other day, and this is it. And I was seeing this as a Buddhist saying, okay, but at least with happiness, crude Buddhism, I'm going to simplify it, but you know, is like, preferences are changeable, you know, your suffering arises because you've got, not because you just got preferences, but you've got cravings. You can transform craving, and that's the path to true liberation. You know, can you imagine, it's kind of like the inverse, that you should spend all your attention as a human being on like, basically, transforming your inner self, rather than trying to acquire things, which is kind of economics, externally to satisfy them. And what's funny is you go into economic literature at this point in the mid 2000s, when I was doing this, and you're like, there are these models called endogenous preferences, which in economics, you'll know, is fancy terminology for like your preferences can change within the system. And they kind of die out in the 70s, traditionally, because they're too complicated, basically, which is unfortunate, like in macro stuff, they lead to like weird equilibria, and so on. And they only get resurrected, actually, by rational addiction, like the Chicago school use a bunch of them in like the 90s and 2000s for rational addiction models of smoking, you know? But it's like, it's in a weird way, this is one of these things which should have been almost existential to the core economics, because once you think culture is significant, you're like, well, what creates culture, what creates being? And you have some of this in \\[unintelligible - 00:18:30\\], who's your colleague, but you know, there is this stuff on like, bounded rationality and self control, you know, like, I only have so much - this is big in psychology, like ego mode management - self control, what do I spend it on? But that goes deep, like, should I spend my limited self control, or like working hard to acquire stuff, or work hard meditating, for example, right? If you really ran this, you'd be in a very interesting place of like, what shakes being and how should we we, you know, do that? Yeah.\n\nJoe Henrich 19:01\n\nYeah, so I've had this discussion frequently with economists over the years, and the answers have changed, which is, I think, a good thing from my point of view. So, I mean, a good example is Sam Bowles wrote a paper around 1997, which is, it's got endogenous preferences in the title. And it's basically making the case, using lots of different evidence from before that, that humans have endogenous preferences. It's a great paper, but it doesn't go anywhere, right? Or at least, I mean, eventually it turns out to have a big impact but it wasn't like it was on everybody's lips or anything. It didn't have a big immediate impact. I think for the reasons you're suggesting it was a very slow takeoff. People like Nathan Nunn had to get into the development people in there and the economic history people. But whenever I've brought this up and I would start saying things obnoxious to economist like, we know people acquire preferences via cultural learning, I can give you a big pile of evidence to show, so we know preferences are endogenous, why are you assuming they're exogenous? And it was basically the kind of mathematical argument, you said if, if preferences can move around, there's too many parts moving. And we can't, so we're just going to assume this is fixed. And that can't be the right answer.\n\nRufus Pollock 20:14\n\nThat can't be the right answer. And it's sort of kind of profound here. And I mean, I'll give you other practical examples that really touched me. So let's say, you know, let's say you're interested in education policy, and this is one of my favourite examples. Generally, people talk about Finland, as one example, we won't get to debate right now about how well Finland, but certainly, for example, when the first set of cross country assessment came out, which was the OECD PISA stuff, and it came out also, when people didn't know it was a test, which was really important, because once you have a test for a reasonable period of time, it becomes rubbish, unfortunately, because people teach to it. Finland like ace this, you know, it came top or close to the top. And you ask them a question about, well, how can you reproduce the Finnish education system? A lot of our world today will go like, Oh, they have their schools laid out like this, or they have a curriculum like that. But then you say, well, it's actually the culture. For example, if you go and read books, you interview people, they're like, well, you know, we have really high trust of our teachers, also, pupils tend to respect them, or we have a society where being a primary school teacher is the number one desired profession as a woman. And yet, then huge amounts of ink will get, which is kind of, I would say, is a cultural-type explanation. Now, of course, you can influence that by structuring, you know, paying teachers more, but again, they're not actually paying teachers that much more. But it's higher status, it's high prestige, yes. And that's another point, I've actually got a quote, I got it an excerpt from your book. And we should come to that. I think at one point where you say, prestige is a universal amongst cultures. But what is kind of given prestige, what gives you to acquire prestige, whether it's growing big yams - I'm paraphrasing your quote - whether it's growing big yams, or being great, is incredibly variable. And given the centrality of that to what we do in the world, is it high prestige to like consume lots of stuff and be really famous? Or is it high prestige to be a really brilliant scientist? Or is it high prestige to look after the environment? You know, we can kind of just see obviously in front of our eyes, the profound impacts, those things are going to have on our society and very major challenges we face from the climate crisis, to education to inequality to you name it. So just kind of going back on that endogenous preferences, the point for listeners is, there's a revolution happening, in a positive way. I would say economics is the dominant discipline of our age, for good or ill. You know, what I mean, is it reflects the kind of, at least for policymakers or the elite, often a way of thinking about the world and a dominant kind of social policy tool, whether it's abused, I, you know, having been an economist who's given advice to government, you know, I'm not, I'm not blaming, you know, economists for all that happens. But there's a really big revolution that you're describing is happening, potentially, and even is bubbling up in things like economics, where this primacy of culture and the primacy of being, the amount of evidence that's there is really becoming massive, and that can have some profound impacts, is what you're saying.\n\nJoe Henrich 23:33\n\nAnd I mean, I think we should, I mean, economics deserves a hat tip in the sense that I really think in the last 15 years, the field's been very responsive. And there's, you know, I see lots of young economists taking these questions on and, you know, thinking thoughts they wouldn't have done so in the 90s.\n\nRufus Pollock 23:49\n\nI really want to acknoledge that, I think one of the great strengths is quite empirically, the heavy empirical orientation is fantastic. I think the point I would just flag to you, is that going to this point about endogenous preferences, while it is described as a technical barrier, just to go back to like, what would a Buddhist economics look like? There's something kind of baked in, you know, if you go back to Pareto, you know, who weirdly I read about in a sociological survey by Raymond Aron of sociologists like Durkheim and \\[unintelligible - 00:24:19\\], there's something quite deep in the economic way of seeing the world that goes back even to kind of early modernity that's under threat if you take this model seriously. If you take culture and ontology and psychology really seriously. I'll just take one other example here that comes from Buddhism: my preference is not fixed, but also knowing what I really want is hard. And therefore, we live in a society today, I'll just point out, where basically the two things that underpin our most good, summum bonum, which is consumption in the free market and voting and democracy, are both based on the assumption that people know what they want. Now, of course, economists are kind of knocking at the door, you know, Fishing for Fools is written by two Nobel Prize winners, they were economists, but the challenge has always been that really calls into question some profound things about Western society if you keep running with it, just as, I would in analogy with your book, Protestantism called into question profound norms about the nature of the pre modern world, i.e. where did authority come from, how did you decide about things, you know solo scripture or individualism, which, as you point out, had come from a long history of context. But I just point out that, yeah, I think as a scientific discipline, but that's kind of a seismic shift in society as we start to take your and other work seriously.\n\nJoe Henrich 25:54\n\nYeah, that makes sense to me. I mean, just as a practical level, as someone who sometimes finds himself advising young PhD students in economics, is it's still the case that everybody wants a utility function, and that they really want to, you know, they might have an interesting empirical result, but they've got to figure out how to get that result from, you know, a utility function that they have to use to get the result. So and in the sense that individuals as optimizers, you gotta be optimising something and, you know, sometimes in our models of cultural evolution, we think people are very much choosing unconsciously, and they're not weighing costs and benefits in the way suggested by the Standard Model.\n\nRufus Pollock 26:35\n\nYes. So I wanted to build on that this kind of primacy of being thesis, like kind of coming from this emergence of a new discipline of cultural evolution. Anthropology as we put it, in my sense, when I went to university was, it wasn't like economics is prestigious, there's massively endowed business schools and so on. We can see a future where maybe, whatever the department you're in, this new science of culture is going to be pretty major and central to our kind of intellectual field. That's kind of a thesis that I think we're exploring here. Could you say what you think the directions that would go in like over the next 10 or 20 years? Or that you might like to see it go in? What do you think are the trends here? And what are the gaps?\n\nJoe Henrich 27:28\n\nSo I would like to see what you're saying be correct, but I'm not sure it's going to be correct, because, I mean, universities are still so ossified. So it's hard to imagine a university ever saying, um, we're creating a Department of Cultural Evolution. I mean, just to give you a sense, so at Harvard, like many places, the quote \"sciences\" are under one dean and one administrative unit, and then other things are in other administrative units. But the field of cultural evolution takes seriously genetic evolution, thinks of humans as a kind of animal studies, epigenetics and how that might affect cultural preferences. And at the same time, is interested in you know, where do ethnic groups come from, how does social stratification emerge, what leads to innovation, all things that you would find in economics and sociology and other kinds of fields like that, also religion. So I'm interested in the origins and evolution of religion or religions, none of which would normally be on with the biologists and physicists, right? So the organisation of the university makes it hard to have a Department of Cultural Evolution. Now you can always have centres and stuff and there are centres. At the Arizona State University, they have the Department of Human Evolution and Social Change, which is actually kind of an experiment, I guess, where they have the anthropologists together with lots of other disciplines. So that's a case. My department, human evolutionary biology, we sit with the physicists and the biologists, but we do have people who stretch across into these other disciplines like economics. Now, so I'm actually going to a meeting of leading scholars from different disciplines in November, and basically our charge is, that we've given ourselves, is to design a proper and interdisciplinary social science. So for example, a simple question to ask yourself is how would you train a graduate student? You know, and so I, you know, I want them to know how to do ethnography, like I think one of the problems of development economics is that you gotta go there and live among the population to really understand what's going on, but, you know, it's also good to have an instrumental variable or to conduct randomised field trials or all the kinds of things we see in modern economics. So I want all those tools to be available and at the ready for a young student\n\nRufus Pollock 30:09\n\nOne thing you've just mentioned about the future and what gets in the way, particularly, maybe of this term 'culture' is that it's interdisciplinarity, and particularly, it's not interdisciplinarity in the sciences. It's not like biologists and physicists need to hang out, which is already a challenge, it's that biologists need to hang out with anthropologists. And so there's this kind of structural, a general ossification problem. You know, and I am no longer in academia, but I still collaborate and so on, so I know that. So that's one kind of institutional, cultural thing. Let's say things went well, what are kind of the topics you'd like to see studied or like, what are the kind of gaps that are really interesting? To give a concrete example, it seems that you have examples in your book and maybe you can now give some, where we can study a particular feature, you know, you know it might be the way people are going to prepare manioc for eating. Or they're gonna, you know, avoid pellagra by preparing cornmeal in a certain way, you can mention these from your book. Those are very specific, but then what we could call like, memeplexes in another area, like, maybe marriage and family, the marriage and family programme for your Weirdest People example, or even, like, puritanism or sometimes you say the Western world. So they're these much bigger levels, kind of like whole constellations of values, views, beliefs, practices. And you know, from another area that I come from, people have these kind of grand unified theories, which are in fashion in physics, but not in social sciences, you know, there are like major waves of human cultural development. I don't know if you've heard of teal organisations, have you heard of this term teal organisation? No? So there's a guy called Ken Wilber and spiral dynamics, I don't know, this is a whole different topic, which was kind of interested in human development in a broad sense. And this is like people in Harvard and other places, you also got interested in like lifespan development, you know, how do humans evolve over the lifespan, not just developmental psychology. There's a small population of people who kind of did some quite radical stuff, you know, this, Robert Keegan, who you might have heard of, right, which is people can kind of become self transcending, or Maslow, you know, self transcendence, not just self actualizing, we do have data on this stuff. Then what came up was that there was this argument that people's kind of values could evolve in substantive ways, like, you know, we start out focused on me, that's both as a tiny child, but there's an analogy with cultures, cultures are focused on, you know, the big man or something like that. This is very crude simplification now of anthropological evolutionary history. But there's points, like we, for example, we expand our domain of concern from me, to my tribe, to larger groups, and ultimately to the world and then to all beings, for example. And this kind of background have these grand theories of these kind of cultural stages of humanity. And why this has then showed up and been very influential is - maybe more in the management consulting and this discussion of teal organisations - these people who came up with this grand unified theory, ended up using colours. So there's like red societies, red is like the mafia and like, it's all about the strong man or woman. And there's this kind of spectrum. So modernity in this spectrum is orange. It's all about rationality, it's all about reason, it's all about meritocracy, it's about bureaucracy. And then the next age has been kind of more like egalitarian, post modernism, it's, you know, they have this grand unified theory that these standard kind of things that highly correlate, you know in a principal components analysis, it'd be like these different dimensions of values of use that highly correlate to reduce to a smaller dimensional draft. And the teal phase is the next one. And so there is a highly influential book called Reinventing Organisations, influential in Silicon Valley and other places about, we need organisations that are much flatter, but where people have a lot more autonomy, but they also are responsible, where they can kind of coordinate in different ways. And for me, by the way, reading your work, one of the connections was what was this revolution of puritanism, of the reformation. This did, maybe in this case through a religion or some set of views and values, shape how people could coordinate and organise in a radically different way and much more maybe egalitarian way, much more effective way, because people could self police in their heads a bit, you know, God's watching them and so on all these classic stories about it. So, to kind of come back to the question I was asking you, where are we in the science of this? We have now examples, and maybe you could describe, where we can trace a given practice, and it's maybe phylogeny, or its development, or at least demonstrate, you know, certain practices are culturally transmitted. And then you have an example in your book of the marriage of family programmes and quite big one, and how that influenced. But where are we in, like, you know, one day, are we going to be able to say, wow, you know, we can explain how this, you know, this new whole culture evolved, you know, or there's a new pocket of something really new emerging over here in, you know, in the southwestern United States, where, you know, it's got these different features that have never been seen before, together, of a cultural behaviour.\n\nJoe Henrich 36:03\n\nSo, the field, because it focuses on individual learners, at least at the core, an approach like that would be say you're broadly interested in democracy, and you would look at what kinds of cultural beliefs in a population tend to foster the spread of democratic norms, democratic practices, and you could study things like the school committee's vote or how do families operate, do kids have a vote at the dinner table or where they're going to go the next day or something like that. But then, once you begin to get practices like that, the question will be how did those beliefs and practices and institutions, what kinds of things do they attract? Do they make certain other ideas more likely? So for example, one idea that I've toyed with, and it's hard to get good data on it, but the idea that the spread of monogamous marriage may have actually created a milieu that made democracy more likely to spread. And historians have suggested this as well. So that's two unrelated things that you might not normally put together, but because of the way that enforced monogamy alters the marriage pattern for elite men, that might create more equity within families and give women more bargaining power in the household and that may encourage more democracy, right? That's just one kind of hypothesis. But in any case, so we'll be able to say, well, the hope is that we'll be able to say how different practices and beliefs affect each other, thinking about a population and either acquiring or not acquiring these kinds of beliefs. Some ideas, we're going to learn, fit better with aspects of human nature, so they're more readily to get picked up. Maybe there are ideas and practices that don't fit as well with human nature, but are really good for getting people to cooperate, and you need to have a lot of socialisation practices, rituals, other kinds of institutions that help get these hard-to-think practices and ideas into people's heads. So it'll be a kind of complex articulation of psychology, cultural and sort of innate psychology, with all the bits and pieces that form a society, and then thinking about how those bits and pieces fit together. This stuff you were describing with the stages makes me really nervous, because that's not the picture that's emerging; those are made up.\n\nRufus Pollock 38:27\n\nRight, exactly. It's much richer than that, I think. What I guess I would want to ask, which kind of came out of that though, for myself, was when I was asking about the future of the field, one question I guess I would have, is there are things like the World Values Survey, or the European Values Survey. If we had better data, you know I sat there more informally and was like, okay, if one had quite detailed stuff, and you might get it now out of Facebook or things, can you see new norms almost emerging in real time? Just like in genetics, we might say, okay, we haven't seen this gene, this is a new mutation, this is a new thing and we're going to see how it interacts. If one was interested in like, there might be easier things to track, but this spread of sustainability attitudes or the spread of concern for nature, in the next 20 years on the field, might we be able to have more granular cross cultural data?\n\nJoe Henrich 39:39\n\nYeah, that's definitely the way things are going. There's a proliferation of data sets like the World Values Survey, but the real frontier is, well I think, getting data from social media and online sources, and then figuring out how to analyse it using natural language processing. What my lab's working on is trying to measure aspects of psychology, so things like analytic thinking, or tightness and looseness, inclinations towards individualism, impersonal cooperation, and trying to pry that out of text. So, for example, we have the corpus of US newspapers going back to at least 1840 and we're analysing that to study psychological variation across space and time. And we can also do that in the modern world. So, for example, I'm interested in witchcraft and there's a symbol that appears on Twitter which is an evil eye protection symbol, the nazar, and so we're analysing the appearance and diffusion and increasing frequency of the use of that symbol.\n\nRufus Pollock 40:46\n\nAnd there's two parts here, because for me, forgetting even the stages question, the question would be, these kind of memeplexes that there are which comes up, let's say, in more classic stuff, Inglehart and the World Values Survey, we're going to have this crude, good but useful, two dimension, or there's more autonomy or self expression, or the Shalom Schwartz and, you know, these seven factors. But could we get a lot more granular and see that sort of principal components analysis out of like a 50 questionnaire survey? Could we start to see that and see particularly interesting pockets of innovation happening? And then the second point, you're saying, is what's causing that or how they function. What's the causal factors and what causes something to cede or spread? I think that's going back to your first point. There's also these interesting connections between some, maybe, cultural features, it wasn't the intention of it, but the accidental benefit in some other way, like monogamy practices leading to actually growing equality and therefore maybe leading to actually more democracy, which leads to more economic effectiveness or something like that. To take another example from a book I read recently, people are like Burning Man is a nascent micro culture, there are values and norms which are evolving there, which are kind of the frontier of something, you know, it's highly creative. I'm not saying I subscribe to that but it's an example, you might say, how could I work out whether it's really the case that Burning Man has a distinct set of values from the rest of the population, and how is that spreading? How, how do those people when they go there and then they go back to their work, does that transmit? How does it transmit?\n\nJoe Henrich 42:42\n\nYeah, I mean, it would be interesting to think about how you could do that with Burning Man, we're getting an increasing ability to do that. A simple example that that reminds me of is there's this paper in economics, I forget the authors, where there ends up being a situation where people get randomly picked to go to the Hajj, and they go to the Hajj and they experienced that and they actually become more cosmopolitan, and more tuned into the global values as a consequence of that experience. And it's a random assignment situation so you can infer causality. So that's a case where we know there's a ritual that has a certain psychological effect, you can imagine something similar with Burning Man, and then people go back to somewhere and then do those ideas spread? Do they have legs in these different kinds of communities? And then you could try to explain why they might have legs in some communities but not others.\n\nRufus Pollock 43:38\n\nExactly. Why do they take off? And also there's both the context but also, what's the practice? Another example, for me, would always be like you go to a meditation retreat, it'd be an amazing experience, like, this is really important, but what's the half life? You know, you go back to London or Boston and you're back in your normal life, you're like, oh, it was so important to practice every day, and then you don't, and obviously the huge impact of what's called Sangha or community, are there other people practising with you and how? And particularly for pro social practices, that could be a very important question. So both what's the context, but what other things like if people stay in touch, how does that affect that? What things have we already found, maybe if you summarise a bit for us, you give some examples, where we have been looking at this both development and evolution, there are some examples in your book, The Weirdest People in the World, and where the frontier of that is concrete, things that you would want to look at, maybe start with examples of what you have found?\n\nJoe Henrich 44:53\n\nYeah, so my obsession lately has been trying to understand innovation. So, for example, we're working on stuff now, we have a global patent database, which gives us a measure of innovation, at least as captured by patents. So we focus narrowly on Europe and then we say why do some regions of countries have more patents than other parts of countries? And I want to test the ideas developed in the Weirdest People in the World. So what we look at is different parts of, say, Germany spent more centuries under the mediaeval church. And so we're able to connect that to differences in the social structure in terms of the families, and we get that from a different survey. And then we can look at how far people's friendships are based on Facebook data, so that gives us another social measure. And then we can look at aspects of psychology from the European Social Survey, which asked people about trust and fairness and conformity and these kinds of questions. And what we find is that the church affects that, and then those things seem to cash out on more patents. So in places where the church was longer, people are more individualistic, less conformity, more trusting, they have friends that are further away, and they have smaller families, and they produce more patents. And you know, we can compare regions within the same country and hold lots of stuff constant.\n\nRufus Pollock 46:18\n\nSo for listeners, let's just walk this through, going back, maybe to start with, the mediaeval church. It's obviously central to your book, the Weirdst People in the World, which I just cannot recommend to listeners enough, really fascinating, of the rise of the West in a way, like a really interesting answer. But to start with, why is the mediaeval church important here? What's the impact of that, you said, on individualism and family structure? Just walk that through briefly and I get that that's going turn out into psychology and then into patenting. But let's start with that.\n\nJoe Henrich 46:49\n\nYeah, so the branch of Christianity that eventually leads to the Roman Catholic Church began to adopt a set of unusual practices in the global historical perspective. So they, for example, banned cousin marriage, first to first cousins, but then it eventually goes out to sixth cousins around 1000 CE and contracts back just down to third cousins in 1215. They end polygyny, so the Franks and the Celts and stuff were all polygynous, so they end that. They end concubinage. New inheritance practices; rather than patrilineal inheritance, which was common throughout Europe, they have bilateral inheritance, so you inherit your identity through mom and dad. And so that began spreading throughout Europe and what that effectively does is it begins to dismantle the clans of Europe and breaks them down into monogamous nucular families. And of course, the church spreads kind of semi randomly out from Rome and it goes to England early, but then very late to Scotland and Wales and places like that, so there's these interesting patterns of variation. And so I think that had a big effect on how cultural evolution went in those places, and the development of other kinds of institutions. So when you break the family down, the complex kinship structures of lots of societies, they're not only your personal identity, they're the groups that do production and distribution. They're also the groups that are your legal identity in dealing with laws. And when you break people down to nucular families, you get rid of all that and also a lot of the security that goes along with that; who takes care of you if you're injured or old, that used to be your kin network, and now it's got to be done by something else. So these new institutions around 1000 CE begin emerging in Europe. So think about guilds, which eventually become occupational guilds, monasteries begin proliferating, universities pop up, and charterred towns. So these people would join the towns as citizens, participate in the defence and whatnot, they'd often get some privileges and whatnot, and so these charter towns with certain rights to the individual began diffusing through Europe. So new kinds of institutions you wouldn't have seen otherwise. So like when I was talking about democracy before, this is a case where the church did a bunch of things because they thought that God wanted them to do that, just like in Islam, you can only have four wives and in Zoroastrianism, you should marry relatives, right? So religions have different family policies. But that had these downstream implications for the kinds of other institutions that were likely to emerge. And that then affects people's psychology and, downstream, economic productivity, success and competition against other groups.\n\nRufus Pollock 49:30\n\nSo, to summarise, the church had these unusual policies about marriage and family that break down traditional kinship networks and clans. That leads to kind of more individualism, but the consequence is - humans don't function well alone, we need to collaborate with others - instead of the family relationships, we start building more ties outwards. And that leads to more egalitarianism and individualism to these charter towns and so on and so forth. And to finish with the example then is that you have this variable of how long different places in Europe were exposed to the Catholic Church's policies. That cashes out in family structure which cashes out in psychology and behaviours and friendship networks. And that then shows up in, for example, innovation levels. Now, one thing that's kind of negative and positive about this story, I just want to flag again to our policy implication story is, the hard thing about hard things like, this took hundreds or thousands of years, and then has payoffs for hundreds or thousands of years. Often, you know, I was in policy and innovation and so talked to government, they're always like, you know, can't we have a startup fund or something and what we're kind of saying with this is actually, some of the really big things go really deep, and you can't just say we're going to set up a new innovation office, and that's going to lead to more innovation, really, that's one big actual implication of some of this work. But the other way about it, what I hear is, that a long term attitude that supports cultural change can have really, really, really big impacts for a really long time. \n\nJoe Henrich 51:34\n\nYeah, so one way of looking at that story is 'well, it doesn't give us much to do in terms of policy, because we can't affect how long the Catholic Church has been around'. But it does tell you, well, what do I need to get innovation? Well, I need free, trusting and cooperative interactions among cognitively diverse minds. How do I get that? Well, it so happens the US bumbled on to that, by having lots of immigration during the 19th century, and one of the other projects is is we look at what leads to innovation in different US counties. And we find counties that have more diverse last names, meaning people from more different kinds of backgrounds, more different families, leads to more innovation coming in the coming decade. So you can think about this as a kind of measure of cultural diversity measured at the family level, and then we're predicting into the future, how many patents you're going to get. And then you know, so the economists will worry, well, we're not sure that's causal, so what we use are these immigration shocks. So there are these tools from economics that allow you to predict whether a county is going to get an immigration shock and that gives us an infusion of last names leading to more cognitive diversity and more innovation. And so anyway, there's this cool relationship between more immigration and more innovation. And something like, you know, Petra Moser's work where she looks at the immigration quotas that were imposed in the US in 1924; that caused immigration to plummet. Prohibition causes immigration to plummet. Now, prohibition is a great case, because you might think, well, alcohol, people are not drinking, maybe they should have better cognitive processes, but turns out ideas meet in saloons and they make baby ideas there. So anyway, so it gives you a bunch of tools, what are we going to do to create the trusting interaction among diverse minds?\n\nRufus Pollock 53:29\n\nRight, and the other aspect that we're having here is also some insight that allows us to create conditions for this. I think one of the learnings from this cultural thing is that individually we're actually quite dumb, what we have is the benefit of this huge cumulative learning that is our culture.\n\nJoe Henrich 53:58\n\nYeah, and that's a theme that runs through both The Secret of our Success and The Weirdest People in the World, and it's really the core of the new book I'm working on; individuals, especially if you strip us of all our cultural knowledge, we're really not good at solving problems. When we depend on this big download of tools for thinking and problem solving and framing things and you had mentioned ontology, or like what even exists in the world? Do germs exist, does witchcraft exist? What am I working with here? And then of course, our ability to generate new ideas is mostly the recombination of existing ideas that are all circulating in the cultural milieu. And it's the bringing together of those different ideas that really drive a lot. So you've got to nurture the collective brain. Geniuses and whatnot are much less important than in the popular myth, the myth of the heroic adventure, for example.\n\nRufus Pollock 54:53\n\nRight. So basically now we have more knowledge about culture and cultural evolution. While it might take a long time, we can now benefit from that learning and transport stuff. I mean, one example in your book, in The Weirdest People in the World is that this, this might seem negative, but this kind of destruction of traditional kinship networks, which in the long run has its benefits, which China starts doing in 1950s, it's 1950 that I think they ban concubinage, which is polygamy, they start banning, partly in imitation of the West, but the Communist Party did a load of stuff. And the other example, which I'm very close to, because my partner is Taiwanese, you could say the basic Confucian cultural download is quite hierarchical. Classically, if you look at Shalom Schwartz, China would show up as quite hierarchical in the model. But yeah, Taiwan, within a period of 50 years, has become a quite well functioning democracy. This is the point, culture is sticky normally for reasons just because they create institutions, which are equilibriua point, and there's a whole bunch of reasons you can go into as to why it's often hard to change culture. But when it does, because of the way imitation works, it can happen very quickly. So I think the other point is that if we realise that it's culture that we need to shift sometimes, rather than like, we're not going to build a fancy new technology office, it might be like, we need to enable more people to meet in the cafeteria, or we need to have a new attitude to risk taking or something like that; those things can actually move quite quickly, but it's that we do need to be conscious that it's that. If we go and just imitate the layout of Finnish schools, nothing much will happen. But if we imitated the attitude of Finnish teachers or something like that, then we might have a lot of impact.\n\nJoe Henrich 56:49\n\nYeah, I think that's a great point; culture is often sticky and inertial, because you have different institutions that sort of interlock. Even if you have the new Burning Man idea about egalitarianism or something that doesn't fit with all the other practices and stuff in the society so it's hard for it to get moving, but if you reorganise things, so that there's not disincentives to adopting or spreading that idea, then things can change quickly, like the Taiwan case; there's lots of cases like that.\n\nRufus Pollock 57:19\n\nYes. You've mentioned, while obviously built on the marriage and family programme, the spread of literacy with Protestantism was a very rapid change in the level of reading. So, just to go back, are there other examples? So the marriage and family programme, knowing research stuff, that probably took a lot of thought. And there are other examples that are fascinating in your book, like, the Ilahita tribe. Why I want to mention these is in our day and age today, the challenges that we face, most dramatically the ecological crisis we face, are collective action problems. And you could see one massive aspect of what you call social institutions, but also culture, as having been ways, often because of intergroup competition, to scale cooperation in some way. Could you talk a little bit about maybe the example there, or other examples you've come across, where groups have scaled. And because I mentioned the \\[unintelligable 00:58:31\\], we kind of somehow need to scale a bit globally; we somehow need to have enough identification or connection that we can act on these wicked problems that we face. And obviously societies have done that, you know, and the Ilahita had a wicked problem with a neighbour that was going take them over. Maybe with that example or others, can you talk that through a bit for the audience?\n\nJoe Henrich 58:54\n\nYeah, the Ilahita case is interesting, because it's a small scale society of the Arapesh in New Guinea. And anthropologists who had been studying this region thought there was a kind of ecological threshold, ecology was forcing people not to have communities more than about 300 people, or 70 men. So they thought that groups were bumping up against this, but then they found this exceptional village of, depending on how you count, 1500 or 2500, people were living in Iligita and it was the most powerful community in the area, it was very safe from its neighbours, because they had such a large fighting force compared to the other groups. And what had happened there was they had the same system as everybody else, but there was this aggressively expanding group nearby that seemed to have a ritual cult of some kind. And when they copied the cult, they made certain mistakes in which they ended up with communal-wide gods and a communal-wide set of rituals that kind of build bridges between the different clans. And it turns out when these communities split, they split along clan lines. So this structure builds connections between the clans, and helps keep everybody working more harmoniously. And if things start to go bad in the village, people thought that the gods were not happy with them. So they would begin doing the rituals and the rituals are a kind of social technology, which bonds people together and that would re-nurture the bridges between clans and between individuals, and help keep the group together. I use it as a case of institutional evolution, because so much of our institutional evolution is not conscious design. Just to give you one example, people point gto the founding fathers of the US and, of course, a lot of thought went into the Constitution, but they never imagined political parties, or they were against political parties, I should say, they didn't want them to be part of the system. But of course, political parties immediately invaded and have been central to the system. So the system was never designed to have political parties. I mean, that's just an example of an unforeseen consequence. So that's the main point, a lot of my interest has been in how religious ideas foster cooperation and gets spread by this intergroup competition process.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:01:13\n\nWell, of course, just to be clear on religion, again, an area which is often taboo, like, we'll come to the potential dead ends of modernity. If I'm an economist, a lot of stuff is collective action problems, let's call it the most generic version, or private information, like if you really got economic technical about it, like, you're going to do something and I don't know whether you've done it or not. You're going to do my gardening, I don't know how hard you're going to work, or we're going to go fight against the enemy and I don't know if you're going to shirk or not, or all kinds of stuff like that. And, basically, we need some methods of binding cohesion, but also creating internal monitoring; basically ways that you weren't shirk in some way. I'm kind of doing this in nutshell, I'm probably doing  violence for readers who are technical to some of it. And religion obviously plays this central role in doing a whole bunch of things, but obviously, in creating cohesion, but also dealing with with shirking and other types of stuff; you're gonna get punished by the gods, you have examples of taboos in your book, there's many examples. And again, in the Ilahita case, just to flag it, this tribe that grew, let's put it this way, they grew to three or four times the scale that was thought feasible for a group in that area. Can you talk a bit to that? Religion was central there, in what kind of ways, just in that one example?\n\nJoe Henrich 1:02:49\n\nYeah. So the big thing they had there was they had these rituals that would allow men to pass through these age sets and the way that was organised was such that it would create interdependence among men from different clans. So it kind of pulled them together and gave them a sense of psychology of interdependence. We know from work in psychology and related fields, that actually performing a ritual together can increase the amount of binding between you. They also began to believe that these gods that were over the entire community, rather than just the usual clan gods, would punish people and they could use that as an explanation for what would otherwise be witchcraft accusations. And oftentimes, clans would split apart and get angry with each other because if someone died, they would think someone from another clan bewitched him. But now an explanation could be given that it was the action of the village gods, this cult that they had. And anyway, so there's a bunch of little factors that work together there to bind people together. One of the other things about religion besides having punishing gods and shared notions of reality and shared aspects of morality, it also has these rituals, which either bind individuals together, or they bind people to their beliefs, they make people believe more strongly in commitments.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:04:17\n\nNow for today we're coming near the end, we've only just really started this discussion. You talk about it in your book, we could think of an evolutionary tree of culture and practices that, in one sense, could allow for scaling. There's competition between groups, and we could think of this in analogy with genetics in a moment, but there's competition between groups and that's going to pressure development along of like, can you get bigger as a society to some extent, because that's a crude way of defending yourself, at least at the beginning, untill you have nuclear weapons or something. So, one of the points I think you make in The Weirdest People is that what was very unusual about what happened in the West was most other societies have kind of gone a kinship route. And then scaling has happened basically via empire, some kinship-knit elite ends up basically controlling a large number of people, because they have exploitive technologies, or slavery or whatever. But what was really unusual about the West in the long run was that we didn't go that route, yet managed to scale. The point was, if I put it this way, just as there are certain evolutionary dead ends in genetics, we can think of things which are highly adapted, but at some point, the problem about them is they're sort of a dead end. There's no way to go forward from there, you know, they are local maxima, if you like, or whatever. Similarly, kinship, like really developing your kinship structure, can be highly effective. But to go back to our point about institutional equilibria, if you're really, really locked into that, it's very hard to change. Right. Why it comes back to this, we can imagine it if we did do another episode, is where are we going today. So let me take a concrete example, which is, to go back to religion - I'm just gonna be provocative here - the West went down a route which, famously in Weber's phrase, once we let the genie out of the bottle with Protestantism, they didn't realise it, but once you have enough free thinking, you're going to come to science, then you come to materialist reductionism and then, in Weber's phrase, the magic has gone out of the world. Everyone predicted in the late 19th century, well the intellectuals, there's going to be a problem coming, because ultimately it's going to destroy religion. And religion is, what you've described, a major thing that binds us. Now, maybe you could say that science in a certain way is a religion, or there are certain other faiths, but they're very thin faiths, in a way, compared to the other faiths. So one example, I'm just being provocative is, are we in something of a dead end, at the moment, where individualism, which has been fantastic and hugely valuable in lots of ways, I'm at least gonna say, but there are limits like, you know, when they have lots of externalities, there are problems in individualism. And similarly, scientific materialism, which has been hugely productive in many ways, taken to where it is, paints us in to a dead end, and it takes us away from the magic of the world. So I'm just asking this question, maybe we could talk to that particular point, but in a more general question that if we were to have a follow up, if we were starting to paint this, like evolutionary tree, for example, of organisational structures that allow us to scale and solve collective action problems, and we have bad need of that today, where are we? To go back to my question, even of studying little groups with Facebook data of where new stuff is popping up, where is the equivalent of like, you know, Martin Luther, or even the Catholic Church in 50 AD? Where are these? What are our dead ends we feel today? And sometimes our dead ends are actually the most evolved thing because they've exhausted themselves. Where are the other places on our cultural evolutionary tree that are most exciting? Maybe we can't even predict, we don't have that capacity yet. But we at least have the ability to notice when they are happening. Yeah, any comments on that? And I said, maybe at this point, we're at the end of the episode. This is something we might come to you if we had a follow up. But any just immediate thoughts on that?\n\nJoe Henrich 1:08:16\n\nYeah. Well, I just wanted to re describe what you were saying because I think it's a really important point, which is that, in The Weirdest People in the World, I make the case that most societies got complex and larger by building on the notion of kinship intensity, or these complex kinship units, where eventually you have an elite, which is, you know, emperors and lineage, and they're stratified so there's all these other farmers and whatnot, that formed the lower half. And what happened, not intentionally but unintentionally, due to the church's marriage and family programme, Europe gets knocked down and you know, dark ages or whatever, and then it wouldn't rebuild itself, it's going up a different peak that can go higher, at least in terms of economic production. The first one is, in some sense, easier to access, because we are primates, and we have a kin psychology, and we have a bunch of elements of human nature, which makes that one easy to hit. The church puts those away by making taboos against them and that forces it up this other peak. The chances that that's the best of all possible peaks is quite low, right, just as a statistical matter, the second peak we found. So just in kinds of thinking about a broad cultural evolutionary canvas, there must be other recombinations of cultural institutions and ways of thinking that can lead to even greater prosperity or greater happiness, or all the kinds of good things, greater human flourishing. Now, where and what that's going to look like is harder to imagine because I always say that cultural evolution is smarter than we are. But the place to look would be novel recombinations. Right. So we can see some of these around; what's going on in China, it's a recombination of Western capitalism and some other Western institutions, universities, plus a lot of older Chinese statecraft and Chinese institutions. So that's a new recombination. Japan has a new recombination and we're gonna see new recombinations appear in Africa and the Middle East and so we don't know whether those are going to be great pathways or whether they're going to lead to more human flourishing, but they're experiments that are in process all around the globe.\n\nRufus Pollock 1:10:27\n\nWow. I think that's a great point to end on. So thank you very, very much and, listeners, I hope you will tune in if we have a follow up. Thank you so much, Professor Henrich.\n\nJoe Henrich 1:10:38\n\nOkay, great to be with you.

Every month, Valerie Duvauchelle, our Bergerac Praxis Hub tenzo, shares her thoughts in the tenzo notes series._\n\nWe do not always realize how much our life is in danger and how much we are saved daily by our body. Several times a day, the greatest battles of the universe are played out inside our body. Hundreds of thousands of living beings are killed so that billions of others survive and maintain the mysterious balance that makes us a living being.\n\nFrom the stars, our earth appears as an entity in its own right living among its fellow creatures in the solar system. From the earth, each human being is also a full-fledged being living among his fellow human beings in society and in nature. And from the human, each bacterium lives in the middle of its colleagues, in the microbiome (place of the intestinal flora).\n\nIt is on average 100 000 billion living beings that live in us, divided into a hundred species accompanied by yeasts and some viruses and it is on average 600 000 of them that can make us sink. Their world can be a world of wars or a space of peace.\n\n### _Contemplating our body as the habitat of billions of beings is an opportunity to touch our deepest identity_\n\nIn his 2018 manifesto, The Dalai Lama invites us to universal responsibility (New Reality by Sofia Stril-Rever, the age of universal responsibility): that which passes through the realization that all sentient beings are interdependent and that taking care of our environment and of others is taking care of ourselves. We can also address in our lives the \"microversal\" responsibility, the one that allows us to take care of ourselves through our food and to take care of the world.\n\nIn his book \"Taking care of your intestine, the Japanese method to open the pathways of intuition, recover vital energy and reconnect with the deepest self\", Professor Naganuma dares to bring together gastroenterology and spirituality. He explains to us how much our emotional balance depends on our intestines and with it our capacity to feel the world. All we have to do, according to him, is to take care of our bacteria so that it can take care of us.\n\nSo isn't it wonderful news when we think we are cooking for ourselves alone that we are in fact responsible for a dinner party of 100,000 billion beings?\n\n### _To live well is to feed all our others well in order to finally be oneself and become the only ferment of the world_\n\nThe masters often disguise themselves and it is in the form of a punchy grandmother that I discovered the deep meaning of the ancestral culture of lacto-fermentation in Japan. I was invited by Takahashi san, a lay teacher of shojin ryori, to one of his conferences on traditional Japanese food (washoku) and I was not disappointed!\n\nHer teaching was as sharp as a sushi knife and she started her course by going into the heart of the matter:\n\n\"recipes in cooking are death! It is because we are gathered today all together, in this unique configuration, in this common movement initiated by the ancestors that knowledge will be transmitted. It is our fingers and our heart that will have to write the recipe in our body and not some ingredients on a paper, so please do not take any note, I will not tolerate it!”\n\nThen, happy with her effect and with a big smile, she started to talk about her passion: salt which, as for all Japanese people (until this generation), has always been considered as essential to food. The salt, friend of the living, as much present in our bodies as in the oceans and which by its symbiotic capacity makes the lacto-fermented ingredients more alive (increases the production of nutrients up to 200 percent) but also more resilient (unrefrigerated conservation). And it is certainly because the Japanese have been eating fermented food for centuries that this particular taste has become part of their bodies (they have a real appetite for it) but also in their way of thinking: life is movement, a process in constant transformation.\n\n### _Impermanence is lived, cooked and tasted here_\n\nLacto-fermentation is much more than a dietary contribution, it is a physical awareness of the life which crosses us and it is also a way: that of food. We are an organism in constant transformation, in constant fermentation, unique in its balance and imbalance. Just like us, bacteria evolve in the interdependence of contingencies. Lacto-fermentation is also a complementary relationship because if they feed us they also need us to develop in the best possible way. The koji (rice ferment necessary for miso) is watched over like a baby in an incubator for a week by attentive producers who bottle it every 3 hours with humidity or heat. From this relationship with the smallest, a humility is discovered, as well as the grace of the living.\n\nTo cultivate one's own food to become the food that is passed on and to let oneself be continually fermented by life while becoming the ferment of the world… isn't this the formidable proposal that life offers us?\n\n* * *\n\n### _About Valerie_\n\n![](/assets/images/star-portrait--300x200.jpg)\n\nValerie Duvauchelle is a former tenzo in Soto Zen tradition and is currently a conscious food designer for evolutionary communities.\n\nValérie offers retreats and workshops at the [Praxis Hub in Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/).

The reason for our congregation was to take part in a month-long “Embodying Collective Transformation” community residency. Perhaps I’m only speaking for myself when I say that as I stepped off the train in Bergerac, I wasn’t sure what to expect of the following month. I knew the title of the residency, I had read the website, I had spoken with the residency hosts and had checked out the recommended preparatory resources, but what did “embodying collective transformation” actually mean? Was I really going to come away “transformed”? Did I even want to?\n\nWe have just completed a week of intensive training and are now moving into a period of three weeks of co-living, incorporating the practices we have been learning into our daily lives living in community, and continuing our exploration of our overarching question. Sadly, some of our number planned just to stay for the training. While several decided to extend their stay (yay!), we bid Charlotte and Engen farewell with a continually lengthening farewell ritual earlier this week. Just before they left, I was able to hold a short interview with each of them, offering them space to reflect on their experience. As I approach the midway point of my time here, I have decided to ask myself the same questions I asked Engen and Charlotte. Perhaps with this reflection I will find that my original questions - Will I come away transformed? Do I want to be transformed? - are beginning to be answered. \n\n## How would you describe the Embodying Collective Transformation Community Residency if you were telling a friend about it?\n\nWell, to start, one of the best experiences of life. And definitely the most joyful experience I have had in at least a couple of years. From day one, this small bubble, this carefully held container, has felt so safe, so judgment free, so kind and compassionate that I have felt my heart and soul completely open up - open up to let any and all emotions and parts have the space to be held with compassion and curiosity, but also open up to allow so much joy and love in. \n\nWhile I feel this answer accurately describes the ECT residency, I would understand if a friend were still confused as to what it actually is. In short, I would describe this residency as a training week in inner and collective development practices, such as Non-Violent Communication, Internal Family Systems and empathic listening, with the aim that by developing these practices we may develop the ability to approach ourselves, each other, and all situations with curiosity, care and compassion. This week of training is then followed by 3 weeks of co-living in which we develop these learnings through practice in our temporary community. \n\n## What have been some highlights of your experience?\n\nThe top highlight for me is the amazing friendships I have already made. We’re just 10 days in, midway for me, and already I feel so much love for everyone in this house. I hope with all my heart that I manage to keep in touch with everyone once we all go our separate ways. Reunions are already in discussion! What has facilitated these connections for me is the sense of safety I feel here and the vulnerability that this has allowed me to embrace. Rather than feeling a “vulnerability hangover” after sharing openly, I instead feel more and more connected to those who hold space for me, and for those whom I hold space. \n\nA particular highlight for me has been the authentic relating games Johnson has been facilitating. Vulnerability + authenticity + play = a whole lot of joy and laughter!\n\n## What insights and/or learning are you taking from this experience? What capacities do you perceive yourself as having developed through this experience?\n\nThe main insight I have gained over the past 10 days stems from my learning about Internal Family Systems and Richard Schwartz’ conception of the “Self”. For a brief introduction into IFS I recommend watching [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJLv98ks-I&ab\\_channel=Wisdom2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJLv98ks-I&ab_channel=Wisdom2.0) and then reading Schwart’s _No Bad Part_ for a deeper exploration. \n\nThrough a practice of looking inward and perceiving the different voices in me that arise in different situations as different “parts” with different purposes and different needs, I am able to extend compassion and curiosity to these parts. I can explore why they arise and what they are protecting. Awareness of these parts and a gentle treatment of them can allow me to speak _for_ parts, not _from_ parts, when I feel a part activated. For example, in a situation where a part of me feels, say, frustrated, I can look inwards and try and understand why. The answer might be that I am not feeling heard, and that my need is to be listened to and for better communication in that moment. This allows me to speak for this need, as opposed to from a place of frustration which may achieve the opposite from my desire for better communication.\n\nMy biggest insight from this study of IFS is the concept of the “Self”. Schwarts states that when one is unblended from any parts, one’s “Self” can engage with their own parts, with others, with whatever situation, with the “eight Cs”: creativity, courage, curiosity, a sense of connection, compassion, clarity, calm, and confidence. What amazes me is how much this rings true to me. With some training in empathic listening, I had already, unawares, been able to root myself in the “Self” when listening to others; I could sit and listen with curiosity, compassion, calm etc. But now with a greater understanding of the “Self” I can do this much more consciously and intentionally. I can root myself in the Self not just when holding space for others in a very particular setting, but also in meetings, in challenging conversations, and with myself. When I say I “can”, I really mean I have the knowledge I can do this. In reality, I know that being “unblended” from parts is not always easy. But my interest in all this has definitely been piqued, and I look forward to learning more about IFS and putting my learnings and insights into practice.\n\n## What do you think led to this impact?\n\nLooking back on the training week, what strikes me is how carefully considered, how intentional, how well-designed the training and the container for the training felt. I’m not quite sure how the facilitation team managed it, but they created a space that felt so safe to explore these new concepts in. And by exploring these concepts through practicing with one another, the feeling of safety grew and grew as I connected more and more with the other participants. Massive thanks to Jocelyn, Karl, Nadine, and Catherine for the huge amount of time, work and emotional effort they put into this residency.\n\n## What has been challenging? What are your reservations? \n\nLooking back, it has been intense. Intense in a great way, but it’s also been exhausting. The work we have been doing has required us to really look inwards, to examine our different parts, where they arise from and what “exile” they are protecting. I came to this residency, thankfully, at a time when my emotional well being was already pretty strong. I can imagine, had I come here at other times in my life when my mental health was at a low or before I’d already begun working through some stuff that this experience could have perhaps been quite overwhelming; suddenly confronted with parts I didn’t know were there, arising from traumas I had hidden away. However, as I said, the container felt so well held, the environment felt so safe, and the support available was such that I know I would have been fine - it just might have been an even more intense experience. \n\n## Would you recommend this experience to a friend, and if so, why do you think it might be valuable for them?\n\nI would recommend this residency to anyone interested in community who recognises the importance of inner and collective development in caring for our own wellbeing, one another’s wellbeing, and the wellbeing of all life. I have learnt new skills, new practices, I have learnt about myself, I have made new friends, I have met people that maybe one day I might collaborate with on a professional level - I’ve definitely seen some budding collaborations between some participants already - and I’ve just all round had a fantastic time. \n\nWhen I think back to my original questions, was I really going to come away transformed and did I even want to, I think I am beginning to get a sense of an answer. I like to think that rather than transforming myself or going through some drastic change, I’m rather developing what was already there. But through this personal development, what I can transform is how I relate to myself, to others and the world around me. I’m truly excited to go back to my everyday life once I leave here with the knowledge that I have the ability to interact with everyone and everything with creativity, courage, curiosity, a sense of connection, compassion, clarity, calm, and confidence. It will take practice, but with the knowledge that I can and have applied my learnings already and with the support network I have gained during this time, I am so excited to see the impact this will have on my life 💛\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var o=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var w=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var f=Object.getPrototypeOf,u=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(a,e)=>()=>(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),p=(a,e)=>{for(var n in e)o(a,n,{get:e[n],enumerable:!0})},r=(a,e,n,h)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let i of w(e))!u.call(a,i)&&i!==n&&o(a,i,{get:()=>e[i],enumerable:!(h=m(e,i))||h.enumerable});return a};var y=(a,e,n)=>(n=a!=null?c(f(a)):{},r(e||!a||!a.__esModule?o(n,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):n,a)),v=a=>r(o({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var s=g((H,l)=>{l.exports=_jsx_runtime});var k={};p(k,{default:()=>x,frontmatter:()=>b});var t=y(s()),b={title:\"Reflecting on Embodying Collective Transformation\",created:new Date(16681248e5),categories:[\"residency\"],authors:[\"eilidhross\"],image:\"/assets/images/IMG_9736.jpg\"};function d(a){let e=Object.assign({h4:\"h4\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",em:\"em\",p:\"p\",h2:\"h2\",div:\"div\",iframe:\"iframe\"},a.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsxs)(e.h4,{id:\"how-are-we-called-to-deepen-our-individual-and-collective-capacity-to-care-for-the-wellbeing-of-all-life\",children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#how-are-we-called-to-deepen-our-individual-and-collective-capacity-to-care-for-the-wellbeing-of-all-life\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),(0,t.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"\\u201CHow are we called to deepen our individual and collective capacity to care for the wellbeing of all life?\\u201D\"})]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"On the 1st of November, a group of strangers from across the globe came together in a tall house in a small town in the south of France to embark on a journey of inquiry into this question.

This week of training is then followed by 3 weeks of co-living in which we develop these learnings through practice in our temporary community. \n\n\nThe top highlight for me is the amazing friendships I have already made. We’re just 10 days in, midway for me, and already I feel so much love for everyone in this house. I hope with all my heart that I manage to keep in touch with everyone once we all go our separate ways. Reunions are already in discussion! What has facilitated these connections for me is the sense of safety I feel here and the vulnerability that this has allowed me to embrace. Rather than feeling a “vulnerability hangover” after sharing openly, I instead feel more and more connected to those who hold space for me, and for those whom I hold space. \n\nA particular highlight for me has been the authentic relating games Johnson has been facilitating. Vulnerability + authenticity + play = a whole lot of joy and laughter!\n\n\nThe main insight I have gained over the past 10 days stems from my learning about Internal Family Systems and Richard Schwartz’ conception of the “Self”. For a brief introduction into IFS I recommend watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJLv98ks-I&ab\\_channel=Wisdom2.0 and then reading Schwart’s _No Bad Part_ for a deeper exploration. \n\nThrough a practice of looking inward and perceiving the different voices in me that arise in different situations as different “parts” with different purposes and different needs, I am able to extend compassion and curiosity to these parts. I can explore why they arise and what they are protecting. Awareness of these parts and a gentle treatment of them can allow me to speak _for_ parts, not _from_ parts, when I feel a part activated. For example, in a situation where a part of me feels, say, frustrated, I can look inwards and try and understand why. The answer might be that I am not feeling heard, and that my need is to be listened to and for better communication in that moment. This allows me to speak for this need, as opposed to from a place of frustration which may achieve the opposite from my desire for better communication.\n\nMy biggest insight from this study of IFS is the concept of the “Self”. Schwarts states that when one is unblended from any parts, one’s “Self” can engage with their own parts, with others, with whatever situation, with the “eight Cs”: creativity, courage, curiosity, a sense of connection, compassion, clarity, calm, and confidence. What amazes me is how much this rings true to me. With some training in empathic listening, I had already, unawares, been able to root myself in the “Self” when listening to others; I could sit and listen with curiosity, compassion, calm etc. But now with a greater understanding of the “Self” I can do this much more consciously and intentionally. I can root myself in the Self not just when holding space for others in a very particular setting, but also in meetings, in challenging conversations, and with myself. When I say I “can”, I really mean I have the knowledge I can do this. In reality, I know that being “unblended” from parts is not always easy. But my interest in all this has definitely been piqued, and I look forward to learning more about IFS and putting my learnings and insights into practice.\n\n\nLooking back on the training week, what strikes me is how carefully considered, how intentional, how well-designed the training and the container for the training felt. I’m not quite sure how the facilitation team managed it, but they created a space that felt so safe to explore these new concepts in. And by exploring these concepts through practicing with one another, the feeling of safety grew and grew as I connected more and more with the other participants. Massive thanks to Jocelyn, Karl, Nadine, and Catherine for the huge amount of time, work and emotional effort they put into this residency.\n\n\nLooking back, it has been intense. Intense in a great way, but it’s also been exhausting. The work we have been doing has required us to really look inwards, to examine our different parts, where they arise from and what “exile” they are protecting. I came to this residency, thankfully, at a time when my emotional well being was already pretty strong. I can imagine, had I come here at other times in my life when my mental health was at a low or before I’d already begun working through some stuff that this experience could have perhaps been quite overwhelming; suddenly confronted with parts I didn’t know were there, arising from traumas I had hidden away. However, as I said, the container felt so well held, the environment felt so safe, and the support available was such that I know I would have been fine - it just might have been an even more intense experience. \n\n\nI would recommend this residency to anyone interested in community who recognises the importance of inner and collective development in caring for our own wellbeing, one another’s wellbeing, and the wellbeing of all life. I have learnt new skills, new practices, I have learnt about myself, I have made new friends, I have met people that maybe one day I might collaborate with on a professional level - I’ve definitely seen some budding collaborations between some participants already - and I’ve just all round had a fantastic time. \n\nWhen I think back to my original questions, was I really going to come away transformed and did I even want to, I think I am beginning to get a sense of an answer. I like to think that rather than transforming myself or going through some drastic change, I’m rather developing what was already there. But through this personal development, what I can transform is how I relate to myself, to others and the world around me. I’m truly excited to go back to my everyday life once I leave here with the knowledge that I have the ability to interact with everyone and everything with creativity, courage, curiosity, a sense of connection, compassion, clarity, calm, and confidence. It will take practice, but with the knowledge that I can and have applied my learnings already and with the support network I have gained during this time, I am so excited to see the impact this will have on my life 💛\n"},{"title":"Tenzo note #1: hunger in community","image":"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-30.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"valerie","name":"Valerie Duvauchelle","avatar":"/assets/images/Valerie-profile.jpg","body":{"raw":"\nValerie is a passionate advocate for activating new ways of being in the world.

Every month, Valerie Duvauchelle, our Bergerac Praxis Hub tenzo, shares her thoughts in the tenzo notes series._\n\nIt is not uncommon, especially when we are in a group, to see our hunger awaken. But is this sensation really the expression of a physiological need or is it the fear of lack waking up when we share our food in community?\n\n  \nThe answer to this question does not exist; it depends on the body of each person, on his psychological construction crossed with social behaviors. In the absence of answering it, it seems to me nevertheless interesting, like an explorer, to go in search of the different layers which are hidden behind what seems a priori simple, to draw the invisible thread between what belongs to the personal and what belongs to the collective in the construction of our relationship to food, particularly hunger.\n\nTo do this, I would like to start simply from my experience: I have been cooking without animal products for groups for about fifteen years, following the model of the Zen temples based on the 3 bowls with measures per person corresponding to :\n\n- 50 to 60g of cereals\n- 40 to 50g of legumes (including tofu, soy protein, tempeh)\n- 180g of cooked vegetables\n- 130g of raw vegetables\n\nIn addition, we usually add cookies after lunch and a dessert cream or cooked fruit after dinner, and for breakfast, cereals such as porridge, vegetable milk, 45 g of nuts or seeds and 130 g of fresh fruit.\n\nIn my opinion, it is impossible, unless you have lumberjacks in the group, to be hungry with these quantities and yet it regularly happens that one or two people express a real feeling of hunger. But because I think that these hunger-related demands go beyond personal needs, I want to share with you my thoughts on the subject. They\n\nare not scientific, on the contrary, they claim the total subjectivity of the possible reasons for hunger today in the West in the face of what I have observed during all these years.\n\n### Fear of missing out\n\nIt is possible that we confuse hunger with the fear of being hungry, in other words, what we take for hunger is in reality the fear of missing out and we create the psychological rather than physiological need to reassure ourselves by eating before being hungry.\n\n### We've forgotten the sensation of hunger\n\nIt is possible that we confuse the heaviness of digestion with satiety. Having forgotten the sensation of hunger in our privileged countries, we don't know that feeling light before a meal is normal. We forget that the body needs to rest and that hunger signals that the body has had enough rest. Because hunger gives us a feeling of insecurity today we prefer the heaviness of a continuous digestion that exploits the body and fatigues us.\n\n### We are comfortable in our weakened state\n\nMost of us are in continuous digestion which takes a lot of body process and prevents us to be in full energy. This heaviness of the body is connected to the heaviness of our mind and in some way could be comfortable as it weakens our potential full energy which is sometimes too strong to channel.  \n\n### The impact of our socio-cultural reality\n\nWe are rarely aware of the impact of the socio-cultural reality (macro reality) on our personal needs (micro reality). Our food production system was built after the war with the objective of responding to famines but continued to produce according to the same objectives when the needs had disappeared. As a result, we remain conditioned by the fear of lack even when we overproduce. On a personal scale, this paradigm of lack is anchored in our relationship to food, where we disguised our fear in more and more ambitious personal needs.\n\nThis paradigm of fear of lack can put some people in a state of almost permanent vigilance with the stress of having to imperatively protect themselves from a future lack.\n\n### Food Dogmas\n\nThe appearance of food dogmas, \"eating well\", has become for some a daily injunction creating guilt and great stress because eating well today means choosing a food theory often in opposition to another. It is also often the injunction not to deviate from it at the risk of losing one's identity.\n\nIt is possible that the more we want to protect our identity, what we are and what we want to be as an individual, hunger will come to disturb the control of this identity.  \n\n### Transition to a vegan diet\n\nFinally, when one goes from a meat or dairy diet to a diet without animal products, or in the case of transitioning to the cuisine of benevolence (shojin) without garlic or onions, one loses the reference points that one associates with the feeling of satiety: the chewiness, the depth of taste, the intensity of the taste. Everything is different with a more neutral tone for the vegetable. In general, it takes a few days or even a week, depending on the person, for this density of taste to be recognized in the variety of flavors and textures, which is much wider than with animal products. (This is why a little bit of sweetness at the end of the meal normally helps to calm the lack of reference points.\n\nGoing from binary food (based on sweet and salty creating a constant appetite) to a wider range of flavors erasing this appetite, also erases the usual feeling of satiety that often comes from eating more than we need.\n\n## To conclude\n\nThe purpose of this list of possible reasons for our hunger today in the West is not to create new food injunctions but simply to make visible the way our needs are built and how they are correlated with our “feeling” of hunger rather than the “reality” of it.\n\nThe objective remains the same: to deconstruct our personal needs and to make visible a conditioning that prevents us from living fully, both personally and collectively. Conditioning will differ for each person and can’t be a universal reality; for some not having animal products could raise fear of lack while for some others it is a real medical need that should be respected.\n\nFood, in my opinion, is the most direct expression of our collective trauma, therefore observing our relationship to food teaches us a lot while also liberating us.\n\nEvolution, both pragmatically and spiritually, won’t be happening without facing the fear behind our food behaviours. In the Bergerac Praxis Hub, we take out relationship to food very seriously. During our residencies we find ways to answer its complexity and reconnect with the basic joy of it as a community.\n\nTo explore the topics in this essay further:\n\nCheck out Valerie's website: [http://lacuisinedelabienveillance.org](http://lacuisinedelabienveillance.org)\n\nLearn about our Conscious Food Workshops: [https://lifeitself.org/conscious-food-workshop/](https://lifeitself.org/conscious-food-workshop/ )\n\n* * *\n\n### _About Valerie_\n\n![](/assets/images/star-portrait--300x200.jpg)\n\nValerie Duvauchelle is a former tenzo in Soto Zen tradition and is currently a conscious food designer for evolutionary communities.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var i=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var f=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,p=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var w=(o,e)=>()=>(e||o((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),m=(o,e)=>{for(var n in e)i(o,n,{get:e[n],enumerable:!0})},h=(o,e,n,r)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of f(e))!p.call(o,a)&&a!==n&&i(o,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(r=u(e,a))||r.enumerable});return o};var v=(o,e,n)=>(n=o!=null?c(g(o)):{},h(e||!o||!o.__esModule?i(n,\"default\",{value:o,enumerable:!0}):n,o)),b=o=>h(i({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),o);var l=w((z,s)=>{s.exports=_jsx_runtime});var H={};m(H,{default:()=>k,frontmatter:()=>y});var t=v(l()),y={title:\"Tenzo note #1: hunger in community\",created:new Date(16668288e5),categories:[\"community\",\"conscious-food\"],authors:[\"valerie\"],image:\"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-30.jpg\"};function d(o){let e=Object.assign({h4:\"h4\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",em:\"em\",p:\"p\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",h3:\"h3\",h2:\"h2\",hr:\"hr\",img:\"img\"},o.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsxs)(e.h4,{id:\"in-the-zen-community-the-tenzo-is-the-cook-every-month-valerie-duvauchelle-our-bergerac-praxis-hub-tenzo-shares-her-thoughts-in-the-tenzo-notes-series\",children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#in-the-zen-community-the-tenzo-is-the-cook-every-month-valerie-duvauchelle-our-bergerac-praxis-hub-tenzo-shares-her-thoughts-in-the-tenzo-notes-series\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),(0,t.jsx)(e.em,{children:\"In the zen community, the tenzo is the cook.

But is this sensation really the expression of a physiological need or is it the fear of lack waking up when we share our food in community?\n\n  \nThe answer to this question does not exist; it depends on the body of each person, on his psychological construction crossed with social behaviors. In the absence of answering it, it seems to me nevertheless interesting, like an explorer, to go in search of the different layers which are hidden behind what seems a priori simple, to draw the invisible thread between what belongs to the personal and what belongs to the collective in the construction of our relationship to food, particularly hunger.\n\nTo do this, I would like to start simply from my experience: I have been cooking without animal products for groups for about fifteen years, following the model of the Zen temples based on the 3 bowls with measures per person corresponding to :\n\n\nIn addition, we usually add cookies after lunch and a dessert cream or cooked fruit after dinner, and for breakfast, cereals such as porridge, vegetable milk, 45 g of nuts or seeds and 130 g of fresh fruit.\n\nIn my opinion, it is impossible, unless you have lumberjacks in the group, to be hungry with these quantities and yet it regularly happens that one or two people express a real feeling of hunger. But because I think that these hunger-related demands go beyond personal needs, I want to share with you my thoughts on the subject. They\n\nare not scientific, on the contrary, they claim the total subjectivity of the possible reasons for hunger today in the West in the face of what I have observed during all these years.\n\n\nIt is possible that we confuse hunger with the fear of being hungry, in other words, what we take for hunger is in reality the fear of missing out and we create the psychological rather than physiological need to reassure ourselves by eating before being hungry.\n\n\nIt is possible that we confuse the heaviness of digestion with satiety. Having forgotten the sensation of hunger in our privileged countries, we don't know that feeling light before a meal is normal. We forget that the body needs to rest and that hunger signals that the body has had enough rest. Because hunger gives us a feeling of insecurity today we prefer the heaviness of a continuous digestion that exploits the body and fatigues us.\n\n\nMost of us are in continuous digestion which takes a lot of body process and prevents us to be in full energy. This heaviness of the body is connected to the heaviness of our mind and in some way could be comfortable as it weakens our potential full energy which is sometimes too strong to channel.  \n\n\nWe are rarely aware of the impact of the socio-cultural reality (macro reality) on our personal needs (micro reality). Our food production system was built after the war with the objective of responding to famines but continued to produce according to the same objectives when the needs had disappeared. As a result, we remain conditioned by the fear of lack even when we overproduce. On a personal scale, this paradigm of lack is anchored in our relationship to food, where we disguised our fear in more and more ambitious personal needs.\n\nThis paradigm of fear of lack can put some people in a state of almost permanent vigilance with the stress of having to imperatively protect themselves from a future lack.\n\n\nThe appearance of food dogmas, \"eating well\", has become for some a daily injunction creating guilt and great stress because eating well today means choosing a food theory often in opposition to another. It is also often the injunction not to deviate from it at the risk of losing one's identity.\n\nIt is possible that the more we want to protect our identity, what we are and what we want to be as an individual, hunger will come to disturb the control of this identity.  \n\n\nFinally, when one goes from a meat or dairy diet to a diet without animal products, or in the case of transitioning to the cuisine of benevolence (shojin) without garlic or onions, one loses the reference points that one associates with the feeling of satiety: the chewiness, the depth of taste, the intensity of the taste.

The [ecosystem mapping site](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us/) now features visualizations which offer new ways to explore and understand the map, and it is even easier to contribute suggestions and improvements to the site than before. Read more below.\n\n## **New visualizations**\n\nEarlier in the year we created two new visualizations to help people to see how the different organizations in the ecosystem fit together. The first visualization, seen below, maps the organizations in the directory based on their primary focus topic. Topics range from Spirituality & Religion to Politics & Economics, and more. This allows users to see the distribution of organizations across topics, and the predominance of topics within the broader ecosystem. [Explore the visualization.](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us/vis#visualizing-the-ecosystem-by-topic)\n\n![](/assets/images/visualization--1024x911.png)\n\nOur second visualization plots the organizations in the ecosystem based on their approach to social change. Each organization has been given a weighting across three dimensions of inner, cultural and systems change based on the type of change they aim to bring about. We’ve also used colors to represent primary topics, to differentiate the levers that organizations are using to bring about these types of change. [Explore the visualization.](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us/vis)\n\n![](/assets/images/visualization-2.png)\n\n## Making contribution even easier\n\nFrom the outset, we have argued that any successful mapping effort must be collaborative and participatory. We have always intended for this mapping to be a community project, and are grateful for the contributions we have already received through our existing channels.\n\nWe’re now excited to announce that we’ve made it even easier to contribute. We have opened up the site itself, giving it a wiki-like structure, meaning people can contribute and add items directly - no coding required. We hope this can support the ongoing growth of our contributor community, and empower users to continue in collective efforts to make the map ever more useful and informative. For detailed instructions on how to add and edit profiles visit [https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/contributors-guide](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/contributors-guide).\n\n## A note on terminology\n\nWhen we first embarked on this project, the name we opted for was 'Mapping Metamodern'. Upon further consideration, we have decided to move away from the term 'metamodern'.

My research interests have been devoted these past few years to the growth and sustainability of online epistemic communities (open source, open innovation, open science…), and Liuba’s focus had more recently been on the spatial architectures fostering real-world community interactions.\n\nDuring the past year, we have been navigating across a few intentional communities, noticing a common set of questions that would resonate with our own shared interests. In particular, intentional communities are often reported to foster a form of _self-knowledge_ that leads to therapeutic self-care. But what is the recipe that makes such groups best operate? When does communal burn-out disrupt self-care? What is the sweet spot of structure and self-organization for individuals and collectives to dance along? \n\nHaving registered on the mailing list from the Life Itself website, we became aware of the Sympoiesis residencies at the Bergerac Hub. The topics all seemed to cover what was at the center of our current interests. Most importantly, the explicit import of monastic practices into secular collective organizations caught our attention. While Liuba had had a longer history of exposure to monastic practices in her formative intellectual years, I had only recently been exploring this area. Following my personal experiences of togetherness in intentional communities, I had begun exploring how thousands of years of spiritual and religious practices had designed frameworks to foster them. We naturally decided to spend a month in this setting. Which actual residency we would attend was not at the core of our choice, given that all topics covered were relevant to our investigation. Confronting our calendars, we decided to register for the Contemplative Activism (CA) residency. The involvement of Liam in the facilitation also seemed to be a great way to reconvene and exchange further. The website offered significant details on the communal setup and agenda, emphasizing the possibility to work on one’s own projects. The collective work on the topic and the possible adjustments to the agenda were presented as an emergent property of the group itself, which seemed to be a most reasonable approach given the very novel nature of the experiment and topic covered.\n\nWith the pleasant expectation of a welcoming nature and weather in the beautiful South of France, we set sail (or rather, rail) towards Bergerac on the 15th November 2021, arriving just in time for the communal lunch. Arrivals in communities are always a particular moment. You immediately face the prior ties and untold norms that precede you, and spend some time evaluating what they are and how you fit within them. The participant pool was a mix of a “historic” reflection group on CA and of participants with adjacent interests but no (or very weak, like ourselves) prior ties. The participants’ countries of origin was skewed towards the UK, probably because of the sphere of influence of Life Itself’s founders. Despite this founder effect, participants were characterized by large spans of diversity in age (from students to grandparents) and backgrounds (from art to ecology, philosophy or psychology). \n\nThe Bergerac Hub sits within a beautiful wooden mansion next to the Dordogne river. We were assigned to one of its high-ceiling bedrooms that used to be the mansion’s library, and were surrounded by books holding what seemed to be intellectual foundations for the residency, with organizational and management science intermingled with Zen and Buddhist practices. We were also introduced to the house’s dojo, a large, peaceful room that would be the cornerstone of the group's contemplative practices. It is in this very room that we would be introduced to the monastic logic that would structure the residency. \n\n## The Zen way\n\nAt the core of this Sympoiesis residency’s community practices sits its Zen guardian and “meta-facilitator” Valerie. Having spent 12 years in Japan, Valerie has experienced first hand the life of Zen monks in monasteries. She developed a deep knowledge of the Zen practices, symbols and meanings, and transposed her learnings towards what seems to have been their original _raison d’être_: fostering a collective dance where the egos and the group converse through contemplative practices. In other words, she sees in the Zen practices a practical and functional scaffold that to profanes would look like unnecessary and esoteric practices.\n\nFacing the wall of the dojo on this very first day, we collectively contemplate a self-made community map: the Mandala. Spread like constellations on a sky map are small cards containing various communal activities: cleaning, cooking, gardening, repairing. On the side, stickers wait to be filled with names of participants who will designate themselves for particular daily or weekly tasks. On the left, a few cards explicit the daily agenda:\n\n- 7:30am meditation (30 min)\n- 8:30am samu (1h)  \n- 1pm lunch\n- 7pm meditation (30 min)\n- 8:30pm circles (2h)\n\nEach week, a different community member is responsible to ring the bell 5 minutes before each activity. Beside the “expected” meditation practices that I personally had previously associated with contemplative practices, the Samu was new to me. This one hour practice synchronizes participants over their daily community task, creating space for a collective “dance” over communal duties. Holding the space, the “Tenzo”, a role first held by Valerie and consequently passed on to other participants, ensures that the dance is well coordinated, and takes on the difficult task to both partake in and supervise. \n\n![](/assets/images/mandala-1024x678.jpeg)\n\nSchematic depiction of the Mandala, with participants assuming daily and weekly roles. Drawing by L. Bauer.\n\nThis monastic scaffold would little by little become fully meaningful as to how it helps shape communal life. In the dojo, all facing in the same direction while sitting on the Zafu pillow that we choose, keep and care for during the whole residency, the Zazen meditation practice creates a space for collectively breathing out our thoughts and concerns. Emptied from distractions, the Samu then provides a framing for acting together while staying in the contemplative state. The predictability ensured by the carefully crafted tasks and expectations ensures that no one does too little or too much, avoiding the pitfalls of self-organization that can burn out some individuals in ill-defined communal setups. \n\nComplementing the mostly silent Zen routine, daily practices of deep listening ensured that all individual emotions are checked-in and cared for. At the start of each evening meditation, a check-in with another random participant allowed for intimate reflections to happen. In 3 minutes, each participant would reflect on their status on this particular day to a randomly assigned partner, without interruption. With no need to converse and find a solution to our troubles, and the ensuing expectation of not being judged, personal stories of fragile human beings unfold. Intimate insights that are usually only shared after long, deep friendships have been established. Evening circles create another space for collective listening. Unlike check-ins which are in pairs, evening circles are a one-to-all form of sharing. Taking the shape of a circle, they seek to equalize voices and foster psychological safety. The sharings enter another dimension, with the collective of listeners generating an even stronger emotional resonance. Each fragile and personal story is followed by an even stronger intimate tale, reinforcing even more the feeling of safety for next participants to the point where everything can be shared, even the deepest tensions underlying the collective. And this is where the story of this residency really begins.\n\n![](/assets/images/communal-spaces.jpeg)\n\nThe span of the communal spaces. The house rooms and natural context offers spaces for individual and collective activities that cover a spectrum from contemplative (inward) to discursive (outward) practices. Drawing by L. Bauer.\n\n## **Sitting with the trouble**\n\nThe theme of the residency, “Contemplative activism”, is a neologism fabricated to highlight a tension between two opposite forces. It originated from the frustration of having too little contemplation within activist movements, and too little activism within the contemplative scene. By forcing their combination, the CA group aims to unravel new modes of collective actions that emphasize the role of group contemplative practices in building trust, and ultimately a shared fate. Key to this mission is the idea oftentimes repeated of “sitting with the trouble”. Here, sitting refers to the modus operandi of the Zazen meditation practice, which offers space for an individual to _physically_ sit with their own troubles. But how can we collectively sit with our shared trouble?\n\nWhile initially relatively foreign to me, these reflections took a vivid meaning during the residency. Not so much because we would talk about CA - we actually mostly did _not_ specifically talk about these concepts themselves, apart from maybe 2 sharing circles out of ~20. Instead, we constantly _touched on_ these topics as a byproduct of our other activities. It even became clear, as we were progressing through the residency, that the monthly gathering itself _was_ what the residency was about. Put in other words, the residency was not _about_ contemplative activism, it _was_ contemplative activism. It was not _about_ sitting with the trouble. It _was_ sitting with the trouble. By creating space for emotional sharings and communal intimacy to flourish, the residency created a moment, out of space and time, for _participatory knowing_ to take over _propositional knowing_ in our quest to communicate, understand and learn. \n\n> The residency was not _about_ contemplative activism, it _was_ contemplative activism.\n\nAnd so, in that particular space that revealed to ourselves our deepest emotions, we saw our fears, biases and anger slowly float towards the surface. In a place deprived of judgement, others become the diverse faces of the “world out there”, this same world one would wish to change through activist practices. The “Others” became the mirror of our own selves: how can _they_ not understand _my_ needs? How do _they_ not see their power over _me_? And so does the safe space reveal its true nature: being safe enough to let us meet with our trouble. Contemplate it. Sit with it. Learn to live with it. Share it. Infuse it to the group. So that we all sit with it. Feel it. Adjust to it. Attune to it. Act on it. It is only then that we realize that contemplating, _digesting_, as a group, our deepest tensions, is the foundation of Contemplative Activism. And, like digestion, it needs time to be fully transformative. \n\n## Tell me who you are\n\nLiving with a group is a deep introspective experience. It makes you face the complex interplay between the _I_ and the _we_. To some extent, it creates space for ego dissolution, which, if done right, can be a therapeutic and philosophical experience. Much has been said on ego dissolution in the context of psychedelic experiences. By chemically altering the perception of the self, psychedelic substances can trigger an ego dissolving experience, leading to the emergence of deep feelings of “oneness” and selflessness. But these come at a price: accepting a total loss of control. And for these experiences to be meaningful and transformative, practitioners have long described the primordial importance of the contextual “(mind)set and setting” within which the experience occurs.\n\nThe Sympoiesis residency’s _set and setting_ was crafted to provide a slow, contemplative ego dissolution within the group. The monastic practices it borrowed from seem to have been specifically designed to optimize for the duration of the experience: minimizing the unexpected perturbations, maximizing the collective d(tr)ance. Removing unnecessary words, judgements, or feedbacks. Becoming merely mirrors to each others’ projections, and fostering gratefulness to only shine back the light, and not the darkness.\n\nThe two last practices of the residency provided an intensive dive into the depth of ego dissolution. First, a conscious food day was organized by Valerie to introduce us to the strict eating practices of Zen monasteries. It was a meaningful introduction to the way that something as usual, as banal as eating, could become a place for experiencing being within a group, and beyond, an ecosystem. The way we would each gratefully serve and receive food from each other while staying aware of our own appetite and of the appetite of the others when deciding the amount we “needed” to eat; the way we would eat by directing the spoon facing our mouth to let “the universe” nourish us and not feel like our own self was guiding the motion; the way we would give some of the warm water used to wash our bowls back to nature, thereby feeling like being “just a bowl” ourselves, an impermanent place of passage; or the way we would silently, conscientiously eat, letting our self expand and contemplate the whole path of events that led to this very moment; all these gave a more vivid meaning to the milder version that had been implemented in the previous weeks and had formed the basis for us forging a unit.\n\nFinally, on the last Saturday of the residency, an “Enlightenment Intensive” practice was organized by the core members from the CA group Carmen and Narresh. With their multiple decades of experience living within intentional communities, they had gained a “secular” wisdom of shaping group practices. The enlightenment intensive practice was an example of a methodological, almost “scientific” method for dissolving egos. What strikes at first with this practice is its apparent simplicity: facing a randomly assigned partner, you ask the question “Tell me who you are”. After contemplating what this question triggers for them, the partner answers for 5 minutes. You then exchange roles. Repeat for 40 minutes. Then change partners, and go at it again. Traditionally taking place during 3 days, we could only spend a morning on it. The 4 hours passed remarkably fast. By presenting the question as a “propositional knowing” agenda about identity, but leaving space for the contemplative “participatory knowing” of the self, the practice methodologically triggers an onion-peeling ego confrontation and, ultimately, dissolution across the group. \n\n![](/assets/images/individual-trajectories-1024x669.jpeg)\n\nRepresentation of Individual trajectories within the communal space, with group synchronization points highlighted spanning the spectrum of contemplative (inward) and discursive (outward) practices.

Bauer.\n\n## Game C\n\nFundamentally, the residency questioned the interplay between order and chaos, top-down and bottom-up governance, predefined structure and self-organization, and, obviously, contemplation and activism. It attempted to find the sweet spot, the intermediate position between both extremes. In music, this intermediate form of structure and structurelessness is embodied in the “jam session” format. In traditional jams, a predefined “theme” (usually a chord progression) is collectively agreed on. In turn, individuals then contribute personal improvisations, in which they take on the limelights temporarily, before surrendering back to the group. Practitioners know how deep listening as well as a seamless rotation of “power” (stronger presence in the sonic space) are key for creating optimal jamming experiences. Some bands even excel at “jam music”. For example, Snarky Puppy leverages a musical “Tenzo” (Michael League) for “holding the \\[musical\\] space” and facilitating the band coordination. Intentional communities seem to be looking for a similar optimization process and reach an “attunement” or harmony between individuals. Some thinkers have recently referred to the “rules of the game” that could naturally foster such a social equilibrium as “Game B”, as compared to the current adversarial rules of “Game A”. By leveraging contemplative practices as a means to this end, this residency might have proposed a “Game C” (for contemplation), where millennia-old monastic protocols are re-integrated and re-imagined in the hope of harmonizing groups, and hopefully society as a whole.\n\n* * *\n\n#### _About Marc_\n\n![](/assets/images/marc-santolini-227x300.jpeg)\n\nMarc Santolini is a long-term research fellow and team leader at [CRI research](https://research.cri-paris.org/) (Paris) and a visiting researcher at the [Barabasi Lab](https://www.barabasilab.com/) ([Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University, Boston).

My research interests have been devoted these past few years to the growth and sustainability of online epistemic communities (open source, open innovation, open science…), and Liuba’s focus had more recently been on the spatial architectures fostering real-world community interactions.\n\nDuring the past year, we have been navigating across a few intentional communities, noticing a common set of questions that would resonate with our own shared interests. In particular, intentional communities are often reported to foster a form of _self-knowledge_ that leads to therapeutic self-care. But what is the recipe that makes such groups best operate? When does communal burn-out disrupt self-care? What is the sweet spot of structure and self-organization for individuals and collectives to dance along? \n\nHaving registered on the mailing list from the Life Itself website, we became aware of the Sympoiesis residencies at the Bergerac Hub. The topics all seemed to cover what was at the center of our current interests. Most importantly, the explicit import of monastic practices into secular collective organizations caught our attention. While Liuba had had a longer history of exposure to monastic practices in her formative intellectual years, I had only recently been exploring this area. Following my personal experiences of togetherness in intentional communities, I had begun exploring how thousands of years of spiritual and religious practices had designed frameworks to foster them. We naturally decided to spend a month in this setting. Which actual residency we would attend was not at the core of our choice, given that all topics covered were relevant to our investigation. Confronting our calendars, we decided to register for the Contemplative Activism (CA) residency. The involvement of Liam in the facilitation also seemed to be a great way to reconvene and exchange further. The website offered significant details on the communal setup and agenda, emphasizing the possibility to work on one’s own projects. The collective work on the topic and the possible adjustments to the agenda were presented as an emergent property of the group itself, which seemed to be a most reasonable approach given the very novel nature of the experiment and topic covered.\n\nWith the pleasant expectation of a welcoming nature and weather in the beautiful South of France, we set sail (or rather, rail) towards Bergerac on the 15th November 2021, arriving just in time for the communal lunch. Arrivals in communities are always a particular moment. You immediately face the prior ties and untold norms that precede you, and spend some time evaluating what they are and how you fit within them. The participant pool was a mix of a “historic” reflection group on CA and of participants with adjacent interests but no (or very weak, like ourselves) prior ties. The participants’ countries of origin was skewed towards the UK, probably because of the sphere of influence of Life Itself’s founders. Despite this founder effect, participants were characterized by large spans of diversity in age (from students to grandparents) and backgrounds (from art to ecology, philosophy or psychology). \n\nThe Bergerac Hub sits within a beautiful wooden mansion next to the Dordogne river. We were assigned to one of its high-ceiling bedrooms that used to be the mansion’s library, and were surrounded by books holding what seemed to be intellectual foundations for the residency, with organizational and management science intermingled with Zen and Buddhist practices. We were also introduced to the house’s dojo, a large, peaceful room that would be the cornerstone of the group's contemplative practices. It is in this very room that we would be introduced to the monastic logic that would structure the residency. \n\n\nAt the core of this Sympoiesis residency’s community practices sits its Zen guardian and “meta-facilitator” Valerie. Having spent 12 years in Japan, Valerie has experienced first hand the life of Zen monks in monasteries. She developed a deep knowledge of the Zen practices, symbols and meanings, and transposed her learnings towards what seems to have been their original _raison d’être_: fostering a collective dance where the egos and the group converse through contemplative practices. In other words, she sees in the Zen practices a practical and functional scaffold that to profanes would look like unnecessary and esoteric practices.\n\nFacing the wall of the dojo on this very first day, we collectively contemplate a self-made community map: the Mandala. Spread like constellations on a sky map are small cards containing various communal activities: cleaning, cooking, gardening, repairing. On the side, stickers wait to be filled with names of participants who will designate themselves for particular daily or weekly tasks. On the left, a few cards explicit the daily agenda:\n\n\nEach week, a different community member is responsible to ring the bell 5 minutes before each activity. Beside the “expected” meditation practices that I personally had previously associated with contemplative practices, the Samu was new to me. This one hour practice synchronizes participants over their daily community task, creating space for a collective “dance” over communal duties. Holding the space, the “Tenzo”, a role first held by Valerie and consequently passed on to other participants, ensures that the dance is well coordinated, and takes on the difficult task to both partake in and supervise. \n\n!\n\nSchematic depiction of the Mandala, with participants assuming daily and weekly roles. Drawing by L. Bauer.\n\nThis monastic scaffold would little by little become fully meaningful as to how it helps shape communal life. In the dojo, all facing in the same direction while sitting on the Zafu pillow that we choose, keep and care for during the whole residency, the Zazen meditation practice creates a space for collectively breathing out our thoughts and concerns. Emptied from distractions, the Samu then provides a framing for acting together while staying in the contemplative state. The predictability ensured by the carefully crafted tasks and expectations ensures that no one does too little or too much, avoiding the pitfalls of self-organization that can burn out some individuals in ill-defined communal setups. \n\nComplementing the mostly silent Zen routine, daily practices of deep listening ensured that all individual emotions are checked-in and cared for. At the start of each evening meditation, a check-in with another random participant allowed for intimate reflections to happen. In 3 minutes, each participant would reflect on their status on this particular day to a randomly assigned partner, without interruption. With no need to converse and find a solution to our troubles, and the ensuing expectation of not being judged, personal stories of fragile human beings unfold. Intimate insights that are usually only shared after long, deep friendships have been established. Evening circles create another space for collective listening. Unlike check-ins which are in pairs, evening circles are a one-to-all form of sharing. Taking the shape of a circle, they seek to equalize voices and foster psychological safety. The sharings enter another dimension, with the collective of listeners generating an even stronger emotional resonance. Each fragile and personal story is followed by an even stronger intimate tale, reinforcing even more the feeling of safety for next participants to the point where everything can be shared, even the deepest tensions underlying the collective. And this is where the story of this residency really begins.\n\n!\n\nThe span of the communal spaces. The house rooms and natural context offers spaces for individual and collective activities that cover a spectrum from contemplative (inward) to discursive (outward) practices. Drawing by L. Bauer.\n\n\nThe theme of the residency, “Contemplative activism”, is a neologism fabricated to highlight a tension between two opposite forces. It originated from the frustration of having too little contemplation within activist movements, and too little activism within the contemplative scene. By forcing their combination, the CA group aims to unravel new modes of collective actions that emphasize the role of group contemplative practices in building trust, and ultimately a shared fate. Key to this mission is the idea oftentimes repeated of “sitting with the trouble”. Here, sitting refers to the modus operandi of the Zazen meditation practice, which offers space for an individual to _physically_ sit with their own troubles. But how can we collectively sit with our shared trouble?\n\nWhile initially relatively foreign to me, these reflections took a vivid meaning during the residency. Not so much because we would talk about CA - we actually mostly did _not_ specifically talk about these concepts themselves, apart from maybe 2 sharing circles out of ~20. Instead, we constantly _touched on_ these topics as a byproduct of our other activities. It even became clear, as we were progressing through the residency, that the monthly gathering itself _was_ what the residency was about. Put in other words, the residency was not _about_ contemplative activism, it _was_ contemplative activism. It was not _about_ sitting with the trouble. It _was_ sitting with the trouble. By creating space for emotional sharings and communal intimacy to flourish, the residency created a moment, out of space and time, for _participatory knowing_ to take over _propositional knowing_ in our quest to communicate, understand and learn. \n\n> The residency was not _about_ contemplative activism, it _was_ contemplative activism.\n\nAnd so, in that particular space that revealed to ourselves our deepest emotions, we saw our fears, biases and anger slowly float towards the surface. In a place deprived of judgement, others become the diverse faces of the “world out there”, this same world one would wish to change through activist practices. The “Others” became the mirror of our own selves: how can _they_ not understand _my_ needs? How do _they_ not see their power over _me_? And so does the safe space reveal its true nature: being safe enough to let us meet with our trouble. Contemplate it. Sit with it. Learn to live with it. Share it. Infuse it to the group. So that we all sit with it. Feel it. Adjust to it. Attune to it. Act on it. It is only then that we realize that contemplating, _digesting_, as a group, our deepest tensions, is the foundation of Contemplative Activism. And, like digestion, it needs time to be fully transformative. \n\n\nLiving with a group is a deep introspective experience. It makes you face the complex interplay between the _I_ and the _we_. To some extent, it creates space for ego dissolution, which, if done right, can be a therapeutic and philosophical experience. Much has been said on ego dissolution in the context of psychedelic experiences. By chemically altering the perception of the self, psychedelic substances can trigger an ego dissolving experience, leading to the emergence of deep feelings of “oneness” and selflessness. But these come at a price: accepting a total loss of control. And for these experiences to be meaningful and transformative, practitioners have long described the primordial importance of the contextual “(mind)set and setting” within which the experience occurs.\n\nThe Sympoiesis residency’s _set and setting_ was crafted to provide a slow, contemplative ego dissolution within the group. The monastic practices it borrowed from seem to have been specifically designed to optimize for the duration of the experience: minimizing the unexpected perturbations, maximizing the collective d(tr)ance. Removing unnecessary words, judgements, or feedbacks. Becoming merely mirrors to each others’ projections, and fostering gratefulness to only shine back the light, and not the darkness.\n\nThe two last practices of the residency provided an intensive dive into the depth of ego dissolution. First, a conscious food day was organized by Valerie to introduce us to the strict eating practices of Zen monasteries. It was a meaningful introduction to the way that something as usual, as banal as eating, could become a place for experiencing being within a group, and beyond, an ecosystem. The way we would each gratefully serve and receive food from each other while staying aware of our own appetite and of the appetite of the others when deciding the amount we “needed” to eat; the way we would eat by directing the spoon facing our mouth to let “the universe” nourish us and not feel like our own self was guiding the motion; the way we would give some of the warm water used to wash our bowls back to nature, thereby feeling like being “just a bowl” ourselves, an impermanent place of passage; or the way we would silently, conscientiously eat, letting our self expand and contemplate the whole path of events that led to this very moment; all these gave a more vivid meaning to the milder version that had been implemented in the previous weeks and had formed the basis for us forging a unit.\n\nFinally, on the last Saturday of the residency, an “Enlightenment Intensive” practice was organized by the core members from the CA group Carmen and Narresh. With their multiple decades of experience living within intentional communities, they had gained a “secular” wisdom of shaping group practices. The enlightenment intensive practice was an example of a methodological, almost “scientific” method for dissolving egos. What strikes at first with this practice is its apparent simplicity: facing a randomly assigned partner, you ask the question “Tell me who you are”. After contemplating what this question triggers for them, the partner answers for 5 minutes. You then exchange roles. Repeat for 40 minutes. Then change partners, and go at it again. Traditionally taking place during 3 days, we could only spend a morning on it. The 4 hours passed remarkably fast. By presenting the question as a “propositional knowing” agenda about identity, but leaving space for the contemplative “participatory knowing” of the self, the practice methodologically triggers an onion-peeling ego confrontation and, ultimately, dissolution across the group. \n\n!\n\nRepresentation of Individual trajectories within the communal space, with group synchronization points highlighted spanning the spectrum of contemplative (inward) and discursive (outward) practices. Drawing by L. Bauer.\n\n\nFundamentally, the residency questioned the interplay between order and chaos, top-down and bottom-up governance, predefined structure and self-organization, and, obviously, contemplation and activism. It attempted to find the sweet spot, the intermediate position between both extremes. In music, this intermediate form of structure and structurelessness is embodied in the “jam session” format. In traditional jams, a predefined “theme” (usually a chord progression) is collectively agreed on. In turn, individuals then contribute personal improvisations, in which they take on the limelights temporarily, before surrendering back to the group. Practitioners know how deep listening as well as a seamless rotation of “power” (stronger presence in the sonic space) are key for creating optimal jamming experiences. Some bands even excel at “jam music”. For example, Snarky Puppy leverages a musical “Tenzo” (Michael League) for “holding the \\[musical\\] space” and facilitating the band coordination. Intentional communities seem to be looking for a similar optimization process and reach an “attunement” or harmony between individuals. Some thinkers have recently referred to the “rules of the game” that could naturally foster such a social equilibrium as “Game B”, as compared to the current adversarial rules of “Game A”. By leveraging contemplative practices as a means to this end, this residency might have proposed a “Game C” (for contemplation), where millennia-old monastic protocols are re-integrated and re-imagined in the hope of harmonizing groups, and hopefully society as a whole.\n\n  *\n\n\n!\n\nMarc Santolini is a long-term research fellow and team leader at CRI research (Paris) and a visiting researcher at the Barabasi Lab (Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, Boston).

Amid the activity, however, we take the time to recognize a special time for us - the marking of one year of residencies in the Bergerac Hub.\n\nOver the coming week will be sharing reflections on and testimonies from our residencies. First up, we have Valerie Duvauchelle, Life Itself Pioneer and co-curator of the Bergerac Hub, who has kindly written down her reflections on a year of “[sympoietic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sympoietic) living”.\n\n## Already one year at the Bergerac Hub\n\nDuring the past year at the Bergerac Hub we explored what it means to become human again. We experienced what it is to sit in the trouble of our time and how, by living together around common practices, this feeling of silent despair could transform into deep joy and a desire to engage in the world with new enthusiasm. \n\nAfter a year of “[sympoietic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sympoietic) living”, during which contemplative activism, eco-spirituality, interbeing, and transformative food were topics given consideration at the hub, we have noticed some common effects among participants: \n\n- Joy of doing things together \n- Reconciliation with one's place in the world \n- Feeling of moving away from the dualistic vision\n- Ajustement to ecoanxiety\n- Self love \n- Legitimacy of doing without having to save the world \n- Intuition that quantity is not the only effective measure \n- Enthusiasm for experiencing loss as a life process\n- Increased energy \n- Re-evaluation of identity \n- Death, grief  integration as a life process\n- Sense of being part of a supportive whole \n- Growing sense of compassion for self, others and the world \n- Apprehension  of deep time (beyond past present future)\n- Humility and grace of being human\n- Desire to let one's essence shine \n- Willingness to contribute in an adjusted way\n\nGenerally, we have witnessed that when people deconstruct their sense of separate identity, it reactivates our ontological capacity to readiness. It seems that by going through our light and shadows together as a community, we become deeply adaptive.\n\nSo, over the next year, we want to continue the path of deconstruction of our atomized self into the neo-trans-individualized self. We will gather in small groups of a dozen people who will live in the frame of the 4 minimum viable practices (the practice of interbeing care, the practice of house care, the practice of food care, and the practice of collective well being care). We will reinvent ourselves, reconnect with rituals, invent a new language and explore the salutary unknown territory of metamodernism.\n\nWe want to continue to create the conditions that allow openness, vulnerability, tolerance to emerge. We want to cultivate a readiness to act in the world as it is.\n\nWe believe these residencies can contribute to changing our perception of the reality that surrounds us and activate another relationship to all beings.

Meditation had not been a core practice for me before. I have previously dabbled in meditation but this experience enabled me to deepen my practice, identify areas for inner transformation and contemplate the state of my emotional well-being. \n\nThis article is as much a guide to Vipassana as an account of my own personal experience. The intention is not to detail the entire process or replicate the incredible resources about Vipassana that are already out there. This is a brief overview to answer the questions I had before starting the course and give a concise entry point for anyone curious about this practice. \n\n## What is Vipassana?\n\nVipassana is an ancient meditation technique that is widely practiced across the world. It stems from [Buddhist tradition](https://lifeitself.org/2022/03/18/mapping-metamodern-zen/), however the meditation technique does not require its practitioners to be Buddhist. In fact, it is offered as a non-sectarian practice that requires no particular belief system. The technique primarily focuses on observation of sensations in the body without reaction to develop self awareness and mindfulness.  \n  \nThere are a number of different lineages of Vipassana, however the most widely practiced was largely popularized by S.N. Goenka, a layman taught in Burma who followed the [Ledi Sayadaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledi_Sayadaw) lineage. Vipassana meditation has been a source of inspiration for many western practitioners such as Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzburg & Ram Dass. It is also a major source of inspiration for the mindfulness movement. \n\n### Where does Vipassana originate from? \n\nIt is said that more than 2500 years ago Gotama the Buddha discovered this technique of meditation. While many other meditations were widely practiced at the time, he included a deeper level of understanding into the meditation practice, which is the separation of sensation from emotion.\n\nThe technique was passed down through the generations by teachers who dedicated themselves to the practice. The tradition was kept alive in Myanmar (Burma) by the Theravada monks and more recently practiced by laypeople as well. \n\nS.N. Goenka, an Indian layman and businessman who lived in Myanmar, was plagued by a rare case of extremely painful chronic migraines. He had tried so many things to cure them, but even doctors in Europe could not find a cure. One day a friend suggested Vipassana to him and he decided to give it a go. \n\nAfter completing a Vipassana course his headaches slowly began to disappear. Naturally, he kept practicing under his teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin, and after 14 years of dedication to the practice he became a teacher. At some point his mother who lived in India fell ill and Goenka traveled to India to teach her Vipassana. \n\nAfter arriving in India and teaching Vipassana to his mother and some select friends and family, word of this technique spread like wildfire. Although it was not his initial intention, Goenka stayed in India to continue teaching. He taught thousands of students and word continued to spread across the world. \n\nGoenka is well known for his charisma and goodwill. He dedicated his life to sharing Vipassana with as many people as he could. To this day live videos of Goenkai filmed in 1991 during his courses are used in courses today. He passed away in 2013, but his work is carried on by the teachers he appointed before his passing. \n\n## How does Vipassana differ from other forms of meditation?\n\nVipassana means to see things as they really are.  The focus of the meditation is to simply observe the sensations that occur in the body without associating them to emotional reaction.  \n  \nThe teachings explain that all reactions that we have in life first begin as a sensation in the body. Only by observing this sensation and sitting with it are we able to maintain equanimity and not react. For example, when you experience anger there is first a sensation in the body of heat and tension and then the emotional response rises from this. Repeated emotional response to a sensation produces cravings and attachments (the grooves of emotional response become deep and habitual).  \n  \nVipassana does not use mantras, visualizations, special breathing techniques, or similar techniques that other meditations do. It is entirely grounded in bodily sensation and breath “as it is”. This is beneficial as there is no prerequisite of a certain belief system and no need to convert to a new set of beliefs. \n\n## How Vipassana has changed my life\n\nPrior to starting the retreat, I felt anxious about participating in 10 days of silence and meditation. Having very little experience with meditation, I was diving straight in at the deep end. I did not know what to expect, nor what would come up for me.  \n  \nOver the course of the 10 days I felt waves of emotion and physical sensations (what I would previously refer to as pain). At first, I could not sit still for more than a few minutes, my mind ablaze with thoughts and ideas. The sensations had control of me and all I could do to appease them was change my seating position over and over.  \n  \nSlowly, my ability to meditate strengthened. I could sit for an hour or more without moving a muscle and the mind chatter also melted away. This opened up for deep, silent contemplation - an opportunity to know myself better.  \n  \nEach night after almost 10 hours of meditation we were played a video recording of Goenka, whose charismatic wisdom resonated perfectly with the experiences of each day. Through meditation and absorbing the wisdom, I came to realize much about my cravings and attachments.  \n  \nI am an emotional eater. I sometimes react unnecessarily to my environment. Just the awareness of these two characteristics alone, plus the applied tools of Vipassana meditation have already changed my life. \n\nNow, I eat less food and I am aware when I want to eat because of emotions. My disposition is much calmer, I no longer get road rage. Interestingly, my tolerance for strong sensations has also dramatically increased. \n\nThere are certainly more subconscious lessons I have learned as well, but these particular points stand out for me. Of course, the journey of self awareness is life long but within just 10 days I have gained so much practical ability to improve my life. \n\n## Is Vipassana meditation for everyone? \n\nWhile my experience is profoundly positive, this type of meditation is not for everyone. This is not due to the practice of the meditation itself, but rather the way in which you must learn the meditation technique. The 10 days meditation course is really the only way to learn the technique fully, yet this is no easy experience.  \n  \nYou can expect deep emotional and physical traumas to rise to the surface, which can sometimes be unbearable. There are many personal accounts of people having adverse reactions to intensive meditation retreats, such as this. The [meditating in safety](https://meditatinginsafety.org.uk/) website is a useful resource for students and teachers to learn more about the potentially harmful effects of meditation.\n\nThat said, if you have a regular meditation practice this will put you in a better position to make the most out of a Vipassana course. It is important to feel prepared for such an intense journey and not dive into it because other people have had a great experience and you want to tick it off of your bucket list. It personally took me three years of contemplation before deciding to take the leap. I am glad I did, but I am also glad I waited for the right moment.  \n  \nIf you feel ready, read on to find out how to apply for a course! \n\n## Where can you do a Vipassana meditation course?\n\nThere are 369 locations across the world that offer Vipassana courses, 233 of these being centers which continuously offer courses. If you have not taken a Vipassana course before you are required to begin with the full 10 day course.  \n  \nOnce you have completed a 10 day course you become an old student, which opens up possibilities for shorter and longer courses, as well as volunteering for service at a course. Providing service is a great way to give back and continue to develop your practice. Furthermore, once you become an old student you gain access to a huge community of Vipassana meditators who have self-organized sits, pilgrimages and much more. \n\n## How to apply for a Vipassana meditation course\n\nTo apply for a Vipassana meditation course you can see the courses nearest to your location on the [Dhamma.org](https://www.dhamma.org/en/courses/search) website. On the website, you can filter by location, date and language the course is taught in.  \n  \nOnce you have found a course that you want to participate in, the application form is simple and easy to complete. The course facilitator will then get in touch to confirm your spot. If you can see there is a short waiting list, it is still worth applying - it is quite common for people to change their mind closer to the date and free up some space.  \n\n## Are Vipassana meditation courses free?\n\nThe short answer is not exactly, but if you truly cannot afford to pay for a course the answer is yes. The Vipassana courses work on a pay-it-forward initiative where the previous students cover the cost for the next set of students.  \n  \nThis is a wonderful model for two reasons. Firstly, it makes the courses accessible to everyone, regardless of financial stability. Secondly, it changes the psychology of the financial contribution, no longer are you paying for a course, but you are giving a wonderful gift to someone else for them to experience what you have just experienced.  \n  \nYou might want to know how much to give. That is really up to you. Remember that your course was paid by someone before you so that you can have this profound experience, so give what you can. If money is an issue, you can also give back by volunteering for service and support others through their courses.\n\n## What to expect during a Vipassana course\n\n### Structure\n\nDuring the Vipassana meditation course, there is a strict routine and structure. Here are a few points that are noteworthy:\n\n- The day begins at 4am with meditation starting at 4:30am. The final meditation finishes at 9pm and lights are out by 10pm\n- Men and women are segregated in the meditation center. The meditation hall is shared but men and women are still separate.\n- Noble silence is practiced throughout the course, however you are able to speak with the teacher.\n- Breakfast and lunch are usually served buffet style, but no evening meal is provided. For new students there is some fruit, but old students fast after midday. \n- Eye contact between students and servers is forbidden, as is any form of physical touch.\n- Stretching, exercise and other spiritual practices are highly discouraged during the 10 days. \n- There are 10 hours of meditation per day which should be diligently practiced. Mostly, this should be carried out in the main meditation hall, however at times it is possible to carry it out in your private room. \n- Reading and writing materials, including electronic devices, are not allowed during the course. These will be confiscated at the beginning of the course and returned afterwards. \n\n### Experience\n\nFor each student, the course experience will be very different but there are some things that are commonly experienced:\n\n- Mind chatter - especially during the first days, quieting the mind for the whole 10 hours is near impossible. Remember, Vipassana is about experiencing things as they are, so acceptance is the key to working through this. \n- Physical sensations (pain) - the purpose of the technique is to become highly attuned to sensation in your body. Initially the painful sensations are distracting and more subtle sensations are harder to observe. Throughout the practice it becomes easier to notice all sensations equally.\n- Emotional rollercoaster - during the 10 days you will likely experience the full emotional spectrum from anger to elation. As old traumas rise to the surface so do these emotional experiences.

Meditation had not been a core practice for me before. I have previously dabbled in meditation but this experience enabled me to deepen my practice, identify areas for inner transformation and contemplate the state of my emotional well-being. \n\nThis article is as much a guide to Vipassana as an account of my own personal experience. The intention is not to detail the entire process or replicate the incredible resources about Vipassana that are already out there. This is a brief overview to answer the questions I had before starting the course and give a concise entry point for anyone curious about this practice. \n\n\nVipassana is an ancient meditation technique that is widely practiced across the world. It stems from Buddhist tradition, however the meditation technique does not require its practitioners to be Buddhist. In fact, it is offered as a non-sectarian practice that requires no particular belief system. The technique primarily focuses on observation of sensations in the body without reaction to develop self awareness and mindfulness.  \n  \nThere are a number of different lineages of Vipassana, however the most widely practiced was largely popularized by S.N. Goenka, a layman taught in Burma who followed the Ledi Sayadaw lineage. Vipassana meditation has been a source of inspiration for many western practitioners such as Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzburg & Ram Dass. It is also a major source of inspiration for the mindfulness movement. \n\n\nIt is said that more than 2500 years ago Gotama the Buddha discovered this technique of meditation. While many other meditations were widely practiced at the time, he included a deeper level of understanding into the meditation practice, which is the separation of sensation from emotion.\n\nThe technique was passed down through the generations by teachers who dedicated themselves to the practice. The tradition was kept alive in Myanmar (Burma) by the Theravada monks and more recently practiced by laypeople as well. \n\nS.N. Goenka, an Indian layman and businessman who lived in Myanmar, was plagued by a rare case of extremely painful chronic migraines. He had tried so many things to cure them, but even doctors in Europe could not find a cure. One day a friend suggested Vipassana to him and he decided to give it a go. \n\nAfter completing a Vipassana course his headaches slowly began to disappear. Naturally, he kept practicing under his teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin, and after 14 years of dedication to the practice he became a teacher. At some point his mother who lived in India fell ill and Goenka traveled to India to teach her Vipassana. \n\nAfter arriving in India and teaching Vipassana to his mother and some select friends and family, word of this technique spread like wildfire. Although it was not his initial intention, Goenka stayed in India to continue teaching. He taught thousands of students and word continued to spread across the world. \n\nGoenka is well known for his charisma and goodwill. He dedicated his life to sharing Vipassana with as many people as he could. To this day live videos of Goenkai filmed in 1991 during his courses are used in courses today. He passed away in 2013, but his work is carried on by the teachers he appointed before his passing. \n\n\nVipassana means to see things as they really are.  The focus of the meditation is to simply observe the sensations that occur in the body without associating them to emotional reaction.  \n  \nThe teachings explain that all reactions that we have in life first begin as a sensation in the body. Only by observing this sensation and sitting with it are we able to maintain equanimity and not react. For example, when you experience anger there is first a sensation in the body of heat and tension and then the emotional response rises from this. Repeated emotional response to a sensation produces cravings and attachments (the grooves of emotional response become deep and habitual).  \n  \nVipassana does not use mantras, visualizations, special breathing techniques, or similar techniques that other meditations do. It is entirely grounded in bodily sensation and breath “as it is”. This is beneficial as there is no prerequisite of a certain belief system and no need to convert to a new set of beliefs. \n\n\nPrior to starting the retreat, I felt anxious about participating in 10 days of silence and meditation. Having very little experience with meditation, I was diving straight in at the deep end. I did not know what to expect, nor what would come up for me.  \n  \nOver the course of the 10 days I felt waves of emotion and physical sensations (what I would previously refer to as pain). At first, I could not sit still for more than a few minutes, my mind ablaze with thoughts and ideas. The sensations had control of me and all I could do to appease them was change my seating position over and over.  \n  \nSlowly, my ability to meditate strengthened. I could sit for an hour or more without moving a muscle and the mind chatter also melted away. This opened up for deep, silent contemplation - an opportunity to know myself better.  \n  \nEach night after almost 10 hours of meditation we were played a video recording of Goenka, whose charismatic wisdom resonated perfectly with the experiences of each day. Through meditation and absorbing the wisdom, I came to realize much about my cravings and attachments.  \n  \nI am an emotional eater. I sometimes react unnecessarily to my environment. Just the awareness of these two characteristics alone, plus the applied tools of Vipassana meditation have already changed my life. \n\nNow, I eat less food and I am aware when I want to eat because of emotions. My disposition is much calmer, I no longer get road rage. Interestingly, my tolerance for strong sensations has also dramatically increased. \n\nThere are certainly more subconscious lessons I have learned as well, but these particular points stand out for me. Of course, the journey of self awareness is life long but within just 10 days I have gained so much practical ability to improve my life. \n\n\nWhile my experience is profoundly positive, this type of meditation is not for everyone. This is not due to the practice of the meditation itself, but rather the way in which you must learn the meditation technique. The 10 days meditation course is really the only way to learn the technique fully, yet this is no easy experience.  \n  \nYou can expect deep emotional and physical traumas to rise to the surface, which can sometimes be unbearable. There are many personal accounts of people having adverse reactions to intensive meditation retreats, such as this. The meditating in safety website is a useful resource for students and teachers to learn more about the potentially harmful effects of meditation.\n\nThat said, if you have a regular meditation practice this will put you in a better position to make the most out of a Vipassana course. It is important to feel prepared for such an intense journey and not dive into it because other people have had a great experience and you want to tick it off of your bucket list. It personally took me three years of contemplation before deciding to take the leap. I am glad I did, but I am also glad I waited for the right moment.  \n  \nIf you feel ready, read on to find out how to apply for a course! \n\n\nThere are 369 locations across the world that offer Vipassana courses, 233 of these being centers which continuously offer courses. If you have not taken a Vipassana course before you are required to begin with the full 10 day course.  \n  \nOnce you have completed a 10 day course you become an old student, which opens up possibilities for shorter and longer courses, as well as volunteering for service at a course. Providing service is a great way to give back and continue to develop your practice. Furthermore, once you become an old student you gain access to a huge community of Vipassana meditators who have self-organized sits, pilgrimages and much more. \n\n\nTo apply for a Vipassana meditation course you can see the courses nearest to your location on the Dhamma.org website. On the website, you can filter by location, date and language the course is taught in.  \n  \nOnce you have found a course that you want to participate in, the application form is simple and easy to complete. The course facilitator will then get in touch to confirm your spot. If you can see there is a short waiting list, it is still worth applying - it is quite common for people to change their mind closer to the date and free up some space.  \n\n\nThe short answer is not exactly, but if you truly cannot afford to pay for a course the answer is yes. The Vipassana courses work on a pay-it-forward initiative where the previous students cover the cost for the next set of students.  \n  \nThis is a wonderful model for two reasons. Firstly, it makes the courses accessible to everyone, regardless of financial stability. Secondly, it changes the psychology of the financial contribution, no longer are you paying for a course, but you are giving a wonderful gift to someone else for them to experience what you have just experienced.  \n  \nYou might want to know how much to give. That is really up to you. Remember that your course was paid by someone before you so that you can have this profound experience, so give what you can. If money is an issue, you can also give back by volunteering for service and support others through their courses.\n\n\n\nDuring the Vipassana meditation course, there is a strict routine and structure. Here are a few points that are noteworthy:\n\n\n\nFor each student, the course experience will be very different but there are some things that are commonly experienced:\n\n\n\n\nI hope that you find this article both practical and useful.

I knelt down to a child and asked:“What do you see that the future is made of?” he answered: “Nothing”. Of all the answers I received to my questions this was the one that struck me the most: for, in reality, our future is indeed made of “nothing” – it is unwritten, it is open. But we tend always to project onto it our opinions, our fears, our hopes which all come from our past experiences. However, only when we get present to the fact that the future is made of nothing can we be present to the fact that we create that future together from what we stand for. What we think, what we say, what we do, creates who we are and will become. \n\n![](/assets/images/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-13.23.29-1024x567.png)\n\nSylvie performing \"Prophecy\", Picture by Max Pugh.\n\nFinally, we were treated to an extraordinary and immersive live musical performance by Laetitia Donoma and Matthieu Le Brun.

Change is not transformation, because change is a way to fix something, it is still trapped in the space of something is wrong. In that space there is still no room for true possibility, because possibility is something created from nothing and in which there is space to bring forth transformation. Fixing is still a dynamic of being against something else, of othering, so we are still trapped in it. \n\nHere is a metaphor: If I repair something I still have the thing I repair, but if I take what is in front of me, just for what it is;  then I can start playing, imagining and creating something new and out of that comes forth something that has never existed before which open new possibilities that were not there before. \n\n![](/assets/images/christelle-hayek-j1wm0mmld2k-unsplash-681x1024.jpg)\n\nAs another crisis had shown up this summer, my heart was saddened.

Because what was I trying to do, have everyone panic with me and run around like headless chickens? And then what? Would we be better equipped to address the situation? So as the weeks unfolded, I looked deeper into the nature of the climate crisis, I realized that well, the opportunity does not lie in fixing the climate crisis but how we address it, let’s put it that way “there is not a lot of change in the climate change mouvement” (echoing Thich Nhat Hanh’s comment that “there wasn’t a lot of peace in the peace movement” of the 60s).\n\nLet me make this concrete. Suppose a new global pandemic or a terrible war killed two thirds of the population. This would “solve” the climate crisis: consumption and CO2 emissions would be radically reduced. But that would not be a **transformation** in how we address the crisis. Nothing would have really changed in humanity.\n\nUltimately, there is no way we can escape death. The question is not: “not dying”, it is how we live whilst we are alive. If we can start relating to each other as brother and sister, with solidarity, and listen to each other as a possibility, if we can bring forth a world that works for everyone, where no one is left behind, where we stop watering the seeds of separation and othering. That would be a breakthrough and an extraordinary outcome. We would be living in a new world where we would be dealing powerfully and peacefully with climate change – where we would have a true “solution” to the climate crisis.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var n=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var g=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var m=Object.getPrototypeOf,w=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var u=(i,e)=>()=>(e||i((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(i,e)=>{for(var o in e)n(i,o,{get:e[o],enumerable:!0})},r=(i,e,o,s)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of g(e))!w.call(i,a)&&a!==o&&n(i,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(s=p(e,a))||s.enumerable});return i};var y=(i,e,o)=>(o=i!=null?c(m(i)):{},r(e||!i||!i.__esModule?n(o,\"default\",{value:i,enumerable:!0}):o,i)),b=i=>r(n({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),i);var l=u((T,h)=>{h.exports=_jsx_runtime});var x={};f(x,{default:()=>I,frontmatter:()=>v});var t=y(l()),v={title:\"Hope after disillusion\",created:new Date(16619904e5),categories:[\"shadows\"],authors:[\"sylvieshiweibarbier\"]};function d(i){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",a:\"a\",div:\"div\",iframe:\"iframe\",strong:\"strong\",img:\"img\",em:\"em\"},i.components);return(0,t.jsxs)(t.Fragment,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"We are in march 2020.

Fixing is still a dynamic of being against something else, of othering, so we are still trapped in it. \n\nHere is a metaphor: If I repair something I still have the thing I repair, but if I take what is in front of me, just for what it is;  then I can start playing, imagining and creating something new and out of that comes forth something that has never existed before which open new possibilities that were not there before. \n\n!\n\nAs another crisis had shown up this summer, my heart was saddened. As I saw the leaves of the tree falling from the heat, smelled the smoke of the forest burning and witnessed the river drying I started to make what was happening wrong and started panicking!  We got to do something! Why is no one doing anything? Then my partner read a paragraph of Thich Nhat Hanh’s writing on aimlessness. Because what was I trying to do, have everyone panic with me and run around like headless chickens? And then what? Would we be better equipped to address the situation? So as the weeks unfolded, I looked deeper into the nature of the climate crisis, I realized that well, the opportunity does not lie in fixing the climate crisis but how we address it, let’s put it that way “there is not a lot of change in the climate change mouvement” (echoing Thich Nhat Hanh’s comment that “there wasn’t a lot of peace in the peace movement” of the 60s).\n\nLet me make this concrete. Suppose a new global pandemic or a terrible war killed two thirds of the population. This would “solve” the climate crisis: consumption and CO2 emissions would be radically reduced. But that would not be a transformation in how we address the crisis. Nothing would have really changed in humanity.\n\nUltimately, there is no way we can escape death. The question is not: “not dying”, it is how we live whilst we are alive. If we can start relating to each other as brother and sister, with solidarity, and listen to each other as a possibility, if we can bring forth a world that works for everyone, where no one is left behind, where we stop watering the seeds of separation and othering. That would be a breakthrough and an extraordinary outcome. We would be living in a new world where we would be dealing powerfully and peacefully with climate change – where we would have a true “solution” to the climate crisis.\n"},{"title":"Life Itself August  2022 Newsletter","image":"/assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-29.jpg","layout":"blog","data":[],"created":"2022-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","authors":[{"layout":"people","data":[],"id":"eilidhross","name":"Eilidh Ross","avatar":"/assets/images/IMG_6159-scaled-e1653305020765.jpg","body":{"raw":"\nEilidh studied Law at the University of Oxford before moving back home to Scotland to gain an MSc in Media, Communications and International Journalism from the University of Glasgow.

One of our partners in this project, [Stephen Diehl](https://www.stephendiehl.com/), is speaking at the inaugural Crypto Policy Symposium on the 5th & 6th of September, 2022.\n\nThe Crypto Policy Symposium will be held online and in London. The  \nsymposium will be keynoted by two leaders on financial policy from the United States and the United Kingdom. This event is organized by a transnational coalition of academics, technologists and focused on public policy solutions to issues surrounding crypto assets.\n\nThe key objective of this conference is to help public sector policy makers and corporate decision makers to go beyond the hype and understand the reality of the crypto economy and its implications. By connecting experts with key decision makers, the hope is that this will inform better decisions regarding this sector, strengthen our democratic institutions, and advance public sense-making on these complex issues. Discussions on policy recommendations, systemic risk, prevention of regulatory capture, and critiques covering cryptocurrencies, ICOs, NFTs, DeFi, “Web3” and blockchains will be covered. This conference brings together the best minds in journalism, law, policy, technology, regulation and banking for two days of panel discussions and community building.\n\nLearn more and register for the Symposium:\n\n[Crypto Policy Symposium 2022](https://crypto-policy.tech/)\n\n## Upcoming Residencies & Retreats\n\n### Sep-Dec 2022: Embodying Collective Transformation\n\n_Sharing personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life._\n\n**What:** A series of three one-month-long residencies consisting of a seven-day intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by a three-week community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives.

Here at the Life Itself Bergerac Hub, we've been hosting our \"Light, Shadow, Integration\" residency. While enjoying the late summer sun and the cooling Dordogne river, we've been dwelling deeply in the present moment and re-exploring our relationship with the intellect. We've been considering, how do we acknowledge our culture’s overrating of thought and theory, and the associated trauma, without getting caught in anti-thought and delusion (which are thoughts)? How do we discuss all the stuff that fills our heads without re-traumatising ourselves?\n\nBehind the scenes, the team organizing our autumn Embodying Collective Transformation residencies have been hard at work getting everything ready for three months of collective transformation. The first residency kicks off in just a week(!) and the team are getting excited to welcome our first cohort of attendees into our beautiful hub.\n\nKeep reading for information on more upcoming events, our latest podcast episodes, and an exciting job opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nEilidh, Communications Associate 💛\n\n\n\n!\n\nThis Sunday, the 27th of August, the Life Itself PlumVillage Hub near Thenac are hosting an event on the theme of Art and Eco-spirituality. It includes a performance of Prophecy by our co-founder and artistic lead Sylvie Barbier.\n\nAdults and children are both welcome for an afternoon of art and performance from 16h00.

One of our partners in this project, Stephen Diehl, is speaking at the inaugural Crypto Policy Symposium on the 5th & 6th of September, 2022.\n\nThe Crypto Policy Symposium will be held online and in London. The  \nsymposium will be keynoted by two leaders on financial policy from the United States and the United Kingdom. This event is organized by a transnational coalition of academics, technologists and focused on public policy solutions to issues surrounding crypto assets.\n\nThe key objective of this conference is to help public sector policy makers and corporate decision makers to go beyond the hype and understand the reality of the crypto economy and its implications. By connecting experts with key decision makers, the hope is that this will inform better decisions regarding this sector, strengthen our democratic institutions, and advance public sense-making on these complex issues. Discussions on policy recommendations, systemic risk, prevention of regulatory capture, and critiques covering cryptocurrencies, ICOs, NFTs, DeFi, “Web3” and blockchains will be covered. This conference brings together the best minds in journalism, law, policy, technology, regulation and banking for two days of panel discussions and community building.\n\nLearn more and register for the Symposium:\n\nCrypto Policy Symposium 2022\n\n\n\n_Sharing personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life._\n\nWhat: A series of three one-month-long residencies consisting of a seven-day intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by a three-week community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives. The immersion includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects. Apply to attend just the week-long training, the entire month-long residency, or multiple months of residency.\n\nWhen: September 2nd-30th; October 1st-30th; November 1st-30th\n\nWhere: Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac, France (near Bordeaux)\n\nWith: Karl Steyaert, Nadine Helm, & Jocelyn Ames\n\nThese residencies are now fully booked, however, please do still get in touch if this is something that interests you. We are opening a waitlist as we will be running more residencies with the Embodying Collective Transformation team in Bergerac and Berlin in the near future.\n\nLearn more & register\n\n\n\nhttps://lifeitself.org/2022/08/09/jeremy-lent-on-interconnection-shifting-worldviews/\n\n\n\nIn episode 7 of the Exploring Social Transformation series of the Life Itself Podcast, we shared a conversation with acclaimed author of ‘The Patterning Instinct’ and ‘The Web of Meaning’, Jeremy Lent. In this episode, Jeremy and Rufus take apart the myth of man’s innate selfishness and dig into how shifts in cultural consciousness have historically come about, what’s coming next, and why we have reason to feel hopeful.\n\n\nhttps://lifeitself.org/2022/08/16/the-new-school-at-commonweal-with-rufus-pollock/\n\n\n\nIn episode 8 of our Exploring Social Transformation series, we were delighted to share a conversation courtesy of the New School at Commonweal with Life Itself co-founder, Rufus Pollock.\n\nIn this conversation, Rufus Pollock sits down with host, Michael Lerner, to discuss Life Itself’s recent work mapping an emerging “metamodern” ecosystem centered on a radical, alternative approach to social change – one that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated, and engaged.\n\n\nThe Cohort 2040 project is seeking a highly motivated Leadership Development Manager to lead a consultation and co-design process for an exciting and ambitious initiative to support emerging leaders navigate a future of deepening environmental crisis.\n\nThe role holder will work in a small team on an engaging, well-connected project that is grappling with two key questions. How can future leaders drive a better, faster sustainability transition as the destabilising impacts of the environmental crisis grow? What can we do now to best support emerging leaders anticipate and prepare for this future?\n\nIf you are interested in these questions or know of anyone who is, contact Laurie (Cohort 2040's director) at laurie@cohort2040.org. Cohort 2040 is hosted by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and collaborates with the Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator and the Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter.\n\n\n\nListing and contact information\n\n\n\nThank you so much for following along with us! We look forward to bringing you all the exciting things we get up to in the next month in September's update. In the meantime, keep up to date by subscribing to our YouTube channel, listening to the Life Itself Podcast, following us on social media, and subscribing to our mailing list.

During this time, the hub expanded from one flat and three people to four flats and a shared space providing a home for eleven people from around the globe. Along the way, many people called this place a home. For some days, a month or longer.\n\nNo one really knew each other before. So this was a great experiment in building community, working with and through diversity and organising a way to be, to learn and to evolve together.\n\nI decided to join the community because living in community was both a long-held curiosity for me and a way to explore Berlin (albeit the pandemic was a very special time for this). And what was first a month extended to two years. Two years that have a been important in many ways and being in community provided a space to learn and discover with fresh eyes how people make home and life through community and who I am in these times.\n\nToday, I believe more than ever that community can be created and cared for in order to support, catalyse and facilitate personal growth and catalyse new ways of living together. This takes both effort in shaping the community together and openness, reflectiveness and stamina by the individuals involved. It is a constant effort molding a way of being, a local culture in response to and driven by the needs of individuals and the particularities of the space and its surroundings.\n\nThe development of such a local (team or community) culture is an emergent phenomena, and as such can not be controlled. Yet, it can be shaped and reflected upon. That needs situations in which the community comes together and can understand what is important for each other at this moment in time, what the needs are, and where to go from here.\n\n## On rules and routines\n\nThe moment people get together in groups the question arises how they want to work or live together and it will be answered; either implicitly or explicitly.\n\nRight from the start, the then community manager and I agreed that we needed to create spaces for the community to come together and provide a space for reflecting how we want to live together. With the growing of the community and new people joining these practices were further developed and supported by the development of value statements and shared visions for the place.\n\nThese efforts to create, maintain and adapt the rules and routines for living well together have of course been challenging (with the dynamics of the covid pandemic a constant invitation to think and rethink agreements), yet incredibly valuable. From the viewpoint of community I want to highlights two essential insights:\n\n1. Writing down values and reading them out loud won’t do the trick. Only listening to each other, dialoging and sitting with the inevitable trouble that arises when different people with different backgrounds come together. They key to developing a shared culture is how a community comes together, not what you write on the wall. The results of these conversations is important (and we developed beautiful, powerful values for the Berlin Hub). Yet, it is the process that matters.\n2. There is a saying in organisational development that many rules create stupid behavior (many paradoxes of beaurocracies seem to confirm this). I think that this is also true for communities. In the development of agreements and rules, I felt that trying to be very precise often misses this or that exception. Within the primacy of being together, rules that are more general, or even contain some paradox, seem to be better suited than overly detailed rules.\n\n## Take care of the place and the place will take care of you\n\nThe place we live in affords certain types of behaviours and attitudes and it responds to and makes tangible the values we live by. And a community space is an odd thing: it is half personal, and half public, being used by the people you life with. And each person going through and making use of the space shapes this environment – in turn shaping the experience of the people coming after you. In effect, a community space is a direct indicator for and expression of the values lived in the community.\n\nWe all know the feeling if we enter spaces that are well cared for. Spaces that feel alive and beautiful. I believe that this happens because these spaces have been shaped by and for the habits of the inhabitants. While the circumstances at the hub were far from ideal in terms of the constraints we had, at the best of times it worked to be a space that served both as a workplace for many and a gathering point for social activities.\n\nWe had a saying during the two years that I still hold as an aspiration in thinking about space: Leave the space better than you found it. In a best case, this creates a virtuous spiral of co-owning the set-up of the space and how it feels: cared for.\n\n## Own your power, own your shit, care for others\n\nWe all come from different places and bring different stories to a life in community. Some people feel more comfortable in speaking up and out, for others this is challenging. Some have access to more resources others less. And these diversities make up the dynamics of relationship.\n\nThe past two years have been a challenging and very rewarding space to learn about how I relate, what I bring to conversations and into relationships and what my privileges and shadows are. In fact, this is one of the key reasons for me to be in community. Not to have therapy (I have that), but the constant invitations to experience the richness of relating to each other in a more aware and hopefully a more healthy way. Doing this involves deep and dark valleys, but they are part of the journey.\n\nThis is only possible if we move in a context that feels safe enough to show up and show ourselves. While others can contribute to this through their awareness for how they relate and show up, for their rank, shadows and privileges, it is ultimately upon ourselves to decide to show up and step into the dynamics of relating. To say yes to our own agency.\n\nStepping into agency also involves being seen by others, being reacted to and exposed to feedback. And this can be very challenging (it was for me). We all bring our bruises and wounds to community, sometimes mistaking what is for what was or what we hope for. And we need to own the baggage that we carry and the feedback we get for it.\n\nAs there are so many others in community it is tempting to locate our irritations with the other. And it is needed to be clear, kind and fast with our feedback to the other, if there is behaviour we do not want or can tolerate.\n\nYet, every irritation is also an invitation to inquire into our reaction, into what story we bring to the situation and what we might have done to escalate or contribute to it. I am more than grateful for the rich feedback and insights I got from being with the people at the Berlin Hub.\n\n## Balance what is and what could be\n\nEveryone comes to community with hopes and dreams. We enter a space and allow ourselves to dream into the possibilities it holds – for ourselves, the community and the space itself. And at the same time, these hopes and dreams are confronted by the realities of others and the constraints of what is.\n\nGenerating spaces to explore what could be was an essential practice within the community. We build models of the shared space, developed visions and values and connected us with the aspirations we hold for ourselves and the community. This is an empowering path that supports us in practicing our imagination, provides orientation and creates momentum and energy.\n\nThis visionary work needs two be balanced on two dimensions.\n\n1. In community, we never develop the vision of what could be on our own. A central learning for me during my time at the hub is that if you want your idea to change the world, it needs to stop to be your idea alone. Maybe this just means that it gets support by others. But most likely this means that your idea gets undone and redone by others. A sense of community arises when people feel they can participate and contribute. When their voice is heard and respected. If people feel that they can balance the ideas by the founders, the elders, the loud-speakers in the community with their own ideas, their own vision this sense of community will be strengthened. This might slow decision making down, this might create sub-optimal solutions in community (be it for keeping powerful people in the community in check), but it enables to build a culture of participation and inclusivity.\n2. A preoccupation with what could be blinds us to see what is. This was certainly true for me: at various points I was unhappy with how the community dealt with the spaces or how committed it was to shared practices and community events. But it was my image of what the life at the hub should be and I overlooked other aspects of what was emerging in the community that people experienced as valuable and enriching.\n\nThere is a fine balance to be found in appreciating and building from what is and working towards what could be. While we need both a grounded realism and bold aspirations, it is important to not sacrifice the here and now for a future that might never realize. And often it might just be best to start from what is and mobilize the good experiences and solutions that are already here and build from there.\n\n## Don’t take yourself too serious\n\n![](/assets/images/Untitled1-1.png)\n\nA community navigates many tension fields: different viewpoints, life trajectories and finding arrangements with money, care, space and pandemics. These tension fields are spoken to and for by different people in the room.\n\nAt the hub, we had long and hard discussions around how we deal with the pandemic for example. And we had voices that advocated for a stricter or less strict handling of the situation (we handled it quite strictly). In these heated discussions it is easy to take arguments personal.\n\nBut often they are not: they are an expression of the paradoxes and tensions in the subject matter itself, expressed through people (and yes: people have preferences for certain things and often take that stand in discussions). These discussions intensify or escalate if we conflate what is said with the person who says it. Assuming a difference between the person and what is said opens up space and supports us in not taking ourselves (and the feedback of others) too seriously.\n\nLiving with others can be outright frustrating sometimes. People live their own lifes and you life yours. They touch and cross at various points: in the kitchen sink, the speech time in meetings and in the moments in which you just had to take that call before the meeting and you show up late. I am certainly tempted to take many things personally and perceive my ideas and invitations to the community as an extension of my self (they are in a way). If they get rejected I got offended.\n\nSitting through many meetings and practices in the past two years made me time and time again aware of the power of humour to open up situations and to laugh about ourselves and the dynamics of the situations. After all, we are all part of this mess. With humour, we can take distance and joy in it.\n\n![](/assets/images/PastedGraphic-2.png)\n\nJoining the Life Itself community in Berlin was a – more or less – spontaneous decision. Albeit I held the intention to live in community at some point in my life, the moment came sudden. What was intended as a month turned into two years. And they have been rich years. I am grateful for this opportunity, these learnings and to those who lived with me in these years!\n\nAt some point in her life, a member of the community started to knit small leaves and over time, there seemed to be abundant supply. It was on the occasion of the first community manager leaving the community that a ritual took shape. The “leave-ing” ceremony. We convened in the shared space and the leave made a round. Each person spoke to the person leaving, sharing a moment or an experience they cherish with that person, what they are grateful for and what they wish the leaving person for the future. Then, the leaving person does the same. For me, this ritual brought together many elements that speak to the functioning of the Berlin Hub and communities: it build on what was there already (the leaves), focused on good memories, strengths and things that we cherish.\n\nThanks to everyone caring for and holding the space over the last two years, striving to make it a home and building a culture of relating wiser.\n\n* * *\n\nJacques is a social psychologist, facilitator, coach and educator.

During this time, the hub expanded from one flat and three people to four flats and a shared space providing a home for eleven people from around the globe. Along the way, many people called this place a home. For some days, a month or longer.\n\nNo one really knew each other before. So this was a great experiment in building community, working with and through diversity and organising a way to be, to learn and to evolve together.\n\nI decided to join the community because living in community was both a long-held curiosity for me and a way to explore Berlin (albeit the pandemic was a very special time for this). And what was first a month extended to two years. Two years that have a been important in many ways and being in community provided a space to learn and discover with fresh eyes how people make home and life through community and who I am in these times.\n\nToday, I believe more than ever that community can be created and cared for in order to support, catalyse and facilitate personal growth and catalyse new ways of living together. This takes both effort in shaping the community together and openness, reflectiveness and stamina by the individuals involved. It is a constant effort molding a way of being, a local culture in response to and driven by the needs of individuals and the particularities of the space and its surroundings.\n\nThe development of such a local (team or community) culture is an emergent phenomena, and as such can not be controlled. Yet, it can be shaped and reflected upon. That needs situations in which the community comes together and can understand what is important for each other at this moment in time, what the needs are, and where to go from here.\n\n\nThe moment people get together in groups the question arises how they want to work or live together and it will be answered; either implicitly or explicitly.\n\nRight from the start, the then community manager and I agreed that we needed to create spaces for the community to come together and provide a space for reflecting how we want to live together. With the growing of the community and new people joining these practices were further developed and supported by the development of value statements and shared visions for the place.\n\nThese efforts to create, maintain and adapt the rules and routines for living well together have of course been challenging (with the dynamics of the covid pandemic a constant invitation to think and rethink agreements), yet incredibly valuable. From the viewpoint of community I want to highlights two essential insights:\n\n\n\nThe place we live in affords certain types of behaviours and attitudes and it responds to and makes tangible the values we live by. And a community space is an odd thing: it is half personal, and half public, being used by the people you life with. And each person going through and making use of the space shapes this environment – in turn shaping the experience of the people coming after you. In effect, a community space is a direct indicator for and expression of the values lived in the community.\n\nWe all know the feeling if we enter spaces that are well cared for. Spaces that feel alive and beautiful. I believe that this happens because these spaces have been shaped by and for the habits of the inhabitants. While the circumstances at the hub were far from ideal in terms of the constraints we had, at the best of times it worked to be a space that served both as a workplace for many and a gathering point for social activities.\n\nWe had a saying during the two years that I still hold as an aspiration in thinking about space: Leave the space better than you found it. In a best case, this creates a virtuous spiral of co-owning the set-up of the space and how it feels: cared for.\n\n\nWe all come from different places and bring different stories to a life in community. Some people feel more comfortable in speaking up and out, for others this is challenging. Some have access to more resources others less. And these diversities make up the dynamics of relationship.\n\nThe past two years have been a challenging and very rewarding space to learn about how I relate, what I bring to conversations and into relationships and what my privileges and shadows are. In fact, this is one of the key reasons for me to be in community. Not to have therapy (I have that), but the constant invitations to experience the richness of relating to each other in a more aware and hopefully a more healthy way. Doing this involves deep and dark valleys, but they are part of the journey.\n\nThis is only possible if we move in a context that feels safe enough to show up and show ourselves. While others can contribute to this through their awareness for how they relate and show up, for their rank, shadows and privileges, it is ultimately upon ourselves to decide to show up and step into the dynamics of relating. To say yes to our own agency.\n\nStepping into agency also involves being seen by others, being reacted to and exposed to feedback. And this can be very challenging (it was for me). We all bring our bruises and wounds to community, sometimes mistaking what is for what was or what we hope for. And we need to own the baggage that we carry and the feedback we get for it.\n\nAs there are so many others in community it is tempting to locate our irritations with the other. And it is needed to be clear, kind and fast with our feedback to the other, if there is behaviour we do not want or can tolerate.\n\nYet, every irritation is also an invitation to inquire into our reaction, into what story we bring to the situation and what we might have done to escalate or contribute to it.
