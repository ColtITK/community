It is part of Life Itself's Sympoiesis series, which are meant to allow people to pursue a work life while spending time in a community of like minded people concerned with a specific question. Our convener is Rupert Read, a former spokesperson of both Extinction Rebellion and the UK Green Party, and Professor of Philosophy at East Anglia University. Rupert's [recent work](https://systems-souls-society.com/what-next-on-climate-the-need-for-a-moderate-flank/) has been focused on organising a moderate, inclusive flank of the climate movement.\n\nAn effective climate movement may require (and certainly would be helped by) a greater spiritual connection with our planet and its sacredness to us, as well as deeper realisation of our interdependent relationship with nature. The question is ─ how can we foster an eco-spirituality, in our personal lives, and public life, that is compatible with a broad based climate movement?\n\nTrue eco-spirituality cannot be a hoop that people need to jump through, a jargon or a club. It must be a welcoming way to live in the paradigm-shift and system-shift that is desperately needed.\n\nWhen we truly accept the present moment in its totality, on the macro as well as the micro level, then we take entirely seriously our yearning for something more beautiful and loving, and our commitment to making it happen. One can accept the present moment globally only by embracing our natural emotions and intentions that imply world-wide change. Real acceptance of life does not mean running away, but _profoundly engaging_ with it ─ as it is.\n\nYou can find out more about Rupert's thinking through the following resources:\n\n[Rupert's EarthTalk at Schumacher College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kbzI_jTGIk)\n\n[Gaia is dead: we have killed her, you and I](https://medium.com/@GreenRupertRead/gaia-is-dead-we-have-killed-her-you-and-i-bb040b1d1fff)\n\n[Religion after the death of God?: the rise of pantheism and the return to the source](https://medium.com/@GreenRupertRead/religion-after-the-death-of-god-the-rise-of-pantheism-and-the-return-to-the-source-54453788bbaa)\n\n[A Film-Philosophy of Ecology and Enlightenment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328645088_A_Film-Philosophy_of_Ecology_and_Enlightenment)\n\n## Residency Structure\n\nThe residency will be structured around regular daily practices focusing on nature connection, and weekly workshops/seminars focusing on the development of an accessible eco-spirituality.\n\nThe exact structure is left deliberately somewhat open in order to adapt to need once the residency commences, but some of the core elements will include:\n\n\\\u003e _Daily practices_: time outside, walking meditation, and land-connective practices.
