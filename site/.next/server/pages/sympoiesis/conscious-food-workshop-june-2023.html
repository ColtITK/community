It is the most direct experience we can have with the world. When we eat, we literally eat the world, the earth, but we also eat what this earth is made of - its mycelium, the agreements found by the hundreds of cooks before us. It is also the whole history of our food that is tasted with each bite, the history of all the relationships it has woven between the land, the people, the animals, and the landscapes.\n\nCooking and eating are much more profound than we imagine, and today, perhaps more than ever in the history of humanity, they offer us the opportunity to remember and recognize that each meal is what binds us together, our depressed identity which bears the imprint of the past, while at the same time marking the future.\n\nThe transformation of the world depends on the way we look at it, and this can be activated by communion with our food. This can only be done through joy, not dogma. It is an activism of contemplation as powerful as militant activism. It is because we eat every day that we live. To reconnect with this reality is to reconnect with the joy of the community of the living which reactivated us, and we can easily spread this way of practicing food like a virus, just by cooking for people around us.\n\n## Program \nDuring this residency you will experience a broader food territory and develop your capacity to contribute better to a new way of living, cooking food that matters in times of trouble.\n\n### Retreat\nStarting with 3 days of deep time grounding to explore how we can cook our life to better nourish the world.\nDuring the retreat  you will learn and live: \n\n- The posture of receiving \n- 6 tastes, colors and textures menus\n- Basic 3-bowl temple food cooking frame\n- 3 spirit of the ( cook) practitioner\n- Canevas base for main dishes, desserts, cookies\n- Eating in 3 bowls ( Oryoki)  and contemplate our food \n- Understand the meaning of the Temple food menus and rituals that can inspire us in our communities \n- Feeling the nourishment of the inbetween \n- Being supported by deep time and lineages.\n\n### Workshop\nDuring this time you will  explore  an integrative food system  that can brings  a deep sense of body mind nourishment from plant based menus to your community.\nDuring the workshop you will learn experiment: \n- Analyze our intimate relationship to food\n- Explore the notion of personal need\n- An integrative approach to food\n- A food system meta-model awareness\n- Roles and organization in the spirited kitchen\n- An internalized scarcity syndrome\n- The cross-disciplinary exploration of the relationship to food today\n- A benevolent community cooking methodology\n- Peace of mind in the kitchen \n- Practice of the situation\n- A way to compose balanced, gourmet vegan menus\n- An inclusive self-perception\n- A different types of satiety\n- The art of recycling\n\n### Community living\nDuring this time  you will integrate the collective food system and createspaces  that inspires new forms of  food activities and conversations. As a new formed organism you will see how the collective embodiment of food  can activate  and inspire your creativity.\nOur time will be rhythmic by our Praxis ecology and the 4 minimal viable practices  (sitting, cooking, cleaning and regulating) and take the time to celebrate the beginning of summer, swimming in the dordogne, paddling; visiting  the Dordogne caves etc… while getting the necessary time to work. \n\n## Daily schedule\n\nHere is the general frame of the 1st week:\n\n- 7h30: posture awakening \n- 8h00: just sitting meditation \n- 8h30: free breakfast\n- 10h00: cooking\n- 12h30: lunch in silence and cleaning\n- 16h30: just sitting 30 mn (during retreat) \n- 17h00: cooking\n- 18h30: dinner and cleaning\n- 19h30: 3 min sharings in pairs\n- 20h45: just sitting meditation (30 mn) (only during retreat) \n\nThe workshop will be the same hours with less sitting, then residency will be co designed to match the needs of this new formed organism. We will be off.\n[APPLY NOW](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiykDKyZR6DgtPKeYuNePy9sWc-qkIc4BVfKBRjkFWKvFp-g/viewform) please register your interest here and Valerie will quickly get back to you.\n\n\n## The Bergerac hub: a  space to explore community of practices.\n\nThe Bergerac Hub is interested in the balance between collective sharing of community care and individual space. Exploring one's personal needs in light of those of the collective is finding the fluctuating middle ground between private and collective, solitary and group activities is the funambulist proposition we explore at the Praxis hub in Bergerac. For this we propose a dynamic framework of Praxis ecology with a structure based on 4 main practices ( sitting , cooking, cleaning and regulating) in which each group can evolve according to its proclivities.\nMore about the hub: https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac\n\n\n[[vault/hubs/bergerac| Learn more about the hub]]\n\n![](/assets/images/IMG_1534-1024x1024.jpeg)\n\n\n## Facilitation \n### Valérie Duvauchelle\n\n![](/assets/images/Eleonore-grignon-pour-ilots-magazine-4-679x1024.jpg)\n\n(photo Eleonore Grigon pour Ilots Magazine)\n\nValerie is a passionate advocate for activating new ways of being in the world. She believes that to live fully we need to allow for a radically different relationship to the world and to ourselves. \nHer specific interest is in the application of new ways of being in community and seeks to understand the invisible evolutionary impulses that occur when we do things together. She is a Tenzo cook in the Zen tradition and through her books, programs and retreats brings the universal teachings of this tradition into conscious community living. \nHer dedicated practice is to cultivate a posture of \"being witness” in her life. She embodies the balance between deep commitment and spontaneous playfulness. Valérie is a pioneer within Life Itself and co-curator of the Bergerac Praxis Hub.\n\nWebsite: [La cuisine de la bienveillance.org](https://en.lacuisinedelabienveillance.org/)\n\nShe also wrote a book about the zen practice of food \"the silent taste\" (Actes Sud).  \n[Full bio here.](https://en.lacuisinedelabienveillance.org/les-messagers)\n\n![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Bol-de-nourriture-1-1-1024x672.jpg](/assets/images/Bol-de-nourriture-1-1-1024x672.jpg)\n(photo credit: Cristelle Enault)\n\n\n## Testimonials\n\n![](/assets/images/class-people-1024x819.jpg)\n\n### Catherine Sengthavy, kinésithérapeute, shiatsu \n\nThe training proposed by Valerie Duvauchelle is unique and original,The strength of this teaching is to realize that questions that could be considered purely practical (how to compose a menu, what quantity, what ingredient to have) stem from a deeper personal reflection.\nThe experience makes it possible to no longer distinguish the limits of what I think I am, the other, the others, the near and the far.\n\n![](/assets/images/IMG-20210803-WA0028-1024x768.jpg)\n\n### Ona Maioco, vegan chef, at [super-naturelle](http://www.super-naturelle.com/)\n\nMy encounter with Valérie has profoundly transformed my relationship with cooking. As a fan of \"flashy\" seasonings, I was able to discover another way of cooking allowing listening before any \"voluntarist\" intervention, erasing the ego and inviting us to a new dance. It's a priceless gift in these troubled times to put cooking back at the heart of our lives and communities, the indispensable engine of our joyful sustenance…and I am so grateful.\n\n![](/assets/images/th.jpeg)\n\n### Sandra dao , retreat Participant, facilitator and owner of [La Source](https://espacedelasource.com/)\n\nOne of the first things that touched me was the fluidity and simplicity with which everything was organized in the kitchen, in a true collaboration. Valerie was able to quickly establish a trust and sharing that was precious to me, and calling upon our own creativity.. There is something life changing about this teaching. \n\n![](/assets/images/th-1-1.jpeg)\n\n### Tiernan Banks , poet and leader of [death crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQLbgRfLdPY)\nThis experience has led me to reflect on: the seeming benefits/importance of (measured) hunger; the importance of variety; the importance of raw foods and balanced flavours. What has been most striking has not just been the physical benefits from this, but the meditative / calming aspects too. It is very rare that a lunch/dinner will inspire this level of reflection in me, and so that in itself speaks volumes!\n\n","code":"var Component=(()=\u003e{var c=Object.create;var l=Object.defineProperty;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var g=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(a,e)=\u003e()=\u003e(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),w=(a,e)=\u003e{for(var n in e)l(a,n,{get:e[n],enumerable:!0})},r=(a,e,n,h)=\u003e{if(e\u0026\u0026typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let t of p(e))!m.call(a,t)\u0026\u0026t!==n\u0026\u0026l(a,t,{get:()=\u003ee[t],enumerable:!(h=u(e,t))||h.enumerable});return a};var v=(a,e,n)=\u003e(n=a!=null?c(g(a)):{},r(e||!a||!a.__esModule?l(n,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):n,a)),b=a=\u003er(l({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var s=f((z,o)=\u003e{o.exports=_jsx_runtime});var H={};w(H,{default:()=\u003eL,frontmatter:()=\u003ey});var i=v(s()),y={authors:[\"valerie\"]};function d(a){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",strong:\"strong\",img:\"img\",a:\"a\",h2:\"h2\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",h3:\"h3\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",br:\"br\"},a.components);return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"09/06 - 02/07/2023\"})}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(e.img,{className:\"internal\",src:\"/assets/images/food-residency-header.jpg\"})}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiykDKyZR6DgtPKeYuNePy9sWc-qkIc4BVfKBRjkFWKvFp-g/viewform\",children:\"APPLY NOW\"})}),`\n`,(0,i.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"what-is-it-about\",children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#what-is-it-about\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"What is it about?\"]}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:`This Residency is both a practical and embodied experience incorporating the basics of the benevolent kitchen that Valerie\nhas actualised from the zen food temple practice and bridged it with permaculture, deep ecology, collective embodiment and\nfood community organization to answer accordingly the questions of our time.`}),`\n`,(0,i.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"context\",children:[(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#context\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,i.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Context\"]}),`\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Food is life in action, a circular process that allows us to receive as well as give.
