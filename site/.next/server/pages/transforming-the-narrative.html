This narrative includes a host of implicit values and views, most importantly its view of the nature of human beings.\n\nOur work in \"Transforming the Narrative\" consists of a combination of think-tank like research, analysis and convening to catalyse conversations for a new narrative together with political and cultural advocacy to translate that into concrete social and institutional change.\n\n## Situation: **\"the past is dying and the future is not yet born**\"\n\nOur default narrative – i.e. individualistic, technocratic materialism for individual and collective wellbeing – is exhausted: no-one thinks doubling GDP will double contentment; and/or not working e.g. the climate crisis.\n\nAt the same time, there is no clear, powerful alternative replacement narrative that is widely vocalized (and accepted) – and even the need for this is debated (cf the culture wars).\n\nThere is a widespread sense of dissatisfaction but without an alternative this does not lead anywhere and results in a sense of resignation or reaction; and finally, there is a general disdain for politics and collective action.\n\nOverall, there is growing sense of crisis.\n\n## Complication\n\nThe default is a continuation of the current trajectory and that has major issues – it’s unfulfilling and even risks catastrophe (e.g. climate crisis, runaway AI). This continuation is not inevitable: we could create new narratives, we could take actions collectively … but we’re not.\n\nThe crisis story and associated fear and resignation freezes us, or leads to reaction, or techno-magic. Furthermore, we have a lot of existing beliefs/assumptions which limits space for imagination (“blindspots”).\n\nThe new narrative must be onto-socio-political in nature (not technological), and that is harder to envision and share – and less directly enrolling – but it is possible.\n\nFor this to happen people have to be able to hold that new narrative at the same time as being in the current one – which is hard. Plus, they must:\n\n1. Be able to  see a path to here to there\n2. Whilst still being anchored in our old beliefs and blindspots\n3. And this a collective problem and so this involves a switch in belief-equilibrium which is not easy and is complicated by the need to co-exist / evolve within the existing paradigm\n\nFinally, we imagine (and believe) together and so we need a space in which this kind of imagining can happen and be taken forward into action.
