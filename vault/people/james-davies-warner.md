James has had a varied career; ranging across music, education consultancy, property developing, and leek planting. When not drumming, he usually can be found with his nose in a history book or out roaming in his native Suffolk's countryside with Heidi (his dog). Having explored how the initial Anglo-Saxon communities were established in Britain for his MA in Medieval History, he is particularly interested in how communities are formed and remain bonded together (or not as the case may be). He also loves model railways and keeps threatening to build one in the spare bedroom.
