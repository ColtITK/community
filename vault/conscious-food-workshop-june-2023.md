This Residency  is both a practical and embodied  experience incorporating the basics of the benevolent kitchen that Valerie has actualised from the zen food temple practice and bridged it  with  permaculture, deep ecology, collective embodiment and food community organization to answer accordingly the questions of our time.

## Overview

The issue of food in communities is now an explored topic. Aware of the destruction of biodiversity that our food production causes, new intentional communities are most often choosing organic food and/or producing some of their vegetables via permaculture. We rarely ask ourselves about the relationship between our intimacy with our food and the global system, and the intersectionality of food is rarely addressed: spiritual as well as practical, linked to inner as well as outer ecology, to fear of death, to identity. On the other hand, there is no frame of reference to structure an integrative daily practice that can anticipate the major problem of food security in the future, and the space of security in relation to the perception of our personal needs.

It is all of these "gaps" that this integrative workshop proposes to explore. The idea here is not to provide ready-made solutions but to help think about food differently, to explore together, in order to find new territories of perception related to the general situation and the particularity that each community encounters with food. 

## The program

## The residency

During this time  you will integrate the collective food system and createspaces  that inspires new forms of  food activities and conversations. As a new formed organism you will see how the collective embodiment of food  can activate  and inspire your creativity.

Our time will be rhythmic by our Praxis ecology and the 4 minimal viable practices  ( sitting, cooking, cleaning and regulating) and take the time to celebrate the beginning of summer , swimming in the dordogne, paddling; visiting  the Dordogne caves etc … while getting the necessary time to work.

## The Bergerac hub : a  space to explore community of practices.

The Bergerac Hub is interested in the balance between collective sharing of community care and individual space. Exploring one's personal needs in light of those of the collective is finding the fluctuating middle ground between private and collective, solitary and group activities is the funambulist proposition we explore at the Praxis hub in Bergerac. For this we propose a dynamic framework of Praxis ecology with a structure based on 4 main practices ( sitting , cooking, cleaning and regulating) in which each group can evolve according to its proclivities.

### Testimonials

> The training proposed by Valerie Duvauchelle is unique and original, in France and perhaps even in Europe.In general, one can encounter the practice of shojin ryori during a sesshin during which the principles are explained to you and live the experience as a practitioner thus receiver of the practice or sometimes in the kitchen, during samu. Valerie proposes us here to position ourselves on the other side, that of the tenzo, a very important role in Buddhist temples. In what does this function consist? What is nourishment? How to think about food and what is at stake? What is the community on a small, medium and large scale? She is the best person to accompany us because she has been a tenzo for several decades in Japan and because she is the referent of the kitchen of benevolence in France. The strength of this teaching is to realize that questions that could be considered purely practical (how to compose a menu, what quantity, what ingredient to have) stem from a deeper personal reflection (who feeds whom, what is it to be satiated etc.. ..)  
> Integrated into the experience of community with daily care, this training offers a pedagogical concentrate where knowledge/savoir-faire/savoir-être become one and disappear naturally.The experience allows to make no longer distinguish the limits of what I think I am, the other, the others, the near and the far.

> My encounter with Valérie has profoundly transformed my relationship with cooking. As a fan of "flashy" seasonings, I was able to discover another way of cooking that gives pride of place to the meeting of the moment with the ingredient, allowing listening before any "voluntarist" intervention, erasing the ego and inviting us to a new dance. My seasonings are now much simpler and even more delicious! This simple but crucial aspect of my cooking has evolved enormously thanks to Valerie: cooking with her and receiving her teaching has allowed me to become aware of my position as a creative cook and teacher. The common thread of her practice, around the activation of the "living" through the act of cooking and eating, has brought to light feelings that I had not been able to connect to anything before. Thanks to her, I now welcome my life as a cook with much more peace and satisfaction. The five contemplations of shojin ryori resonate with me every day, while Valerie's reflections on "goodness" in the kitchen feed my need for simplicity, commitment, resilience and generosity in the kitchen. It's a priceless gift in these troubled times to put cooking back at the heart of our lives and communities, the indispensable engine of our joyful sustenance…and I am so grateful.

> One of the first things that touched me was the fluidity and simplicity with which everything was organized in the kitchen, in a true collaboration. Valerie was able to quickly establish a trust and sharing that was precious to me, not posing as the sole holder of the knowledge, but asking us for our point of view on this or that ingredient to be added, and calling upon our own creativity. She managed to give us a subtle mix of joy and attention that allowed me to learn a lot about food preparation of course, but also about managing a group in the kitchen, in a relatively short time. When I returned, my close family, friends and people who come on retreat to our place of healing, were able to enjoy it fully. The quality of the presentation, the variety of the proposals, the fact that I dared to be even more creative with what I had and the joy that this gave me, were immediately felt by my daily guests. I feel a deep gratitude for what Valerie has given me, and there is something life changing about this teaching. Thank you for this!

> This experience has led me to reflect on: the seeming benefits/importance of (measured) hunger; the importance of variety; the importance of raw foods and balanced flavours. What has been most striking has not just been the physical benefits from this, but the meditative / calming aspects too. It is very rare that a lunch/dinner will inspire this level of reflection in me, and so that in itself speaks volumes!
> 
> The idea that how we approach our food relates to how we approach our lives and way of being is powerful, and not something I had considered properly before, yet it is so obvious when you are made aware of it. With the balance of the 5 flavours to create a neutral, and the reusing of any leftovers in the next meal, and the lack of garlic, and the cleanliness and measured-ness of the cooking process, and the lack of snacks in between meals, and the sitting with our hunger and being at peace with it, as the week wore on the mindfulness of the approach really started to impact my own mindfulness. Given the importance of the food in this shift, I think this is why what I am trying to get at is so hard to say in words; the feeling of being with the food connected somehow to the feeling of how I was being with myself and the world.

Valérie has trained in Zen temple cooking in Japan where she spent fifteen years. Having found in the practice of Shojin Ryôri a path to sitt with the complexity of our relationship to food, both individual and collective, her research explores the possible frameworks of this practice in conscious communities including a _(Non) Methodology for cooks of the communities_.

She also wrote a book about the zen practice of food "the silent taste" ( Actes sud).
