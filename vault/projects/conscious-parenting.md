**Creating a wiser, weller world starts with great parenting. Join us in discovering conscious parenting to create the stewards of the future.**

**Project Date:** Jan 2021 - Present

**Team:** Esther Montmany & [[../people/rufuspollock |Rufus Pollock]]

Our conscious parenting project is a series of offerings from conscious parenting pioneer Esther Montmany. The offerings shed light on the impact of parents behaviours on the child, how to positively transform the role of the parents, and pragmatic tools for all elements of parenting.

Esther has worked with Mauricio and Rebecca Wild at their legendary school in Ecuador and led the children's program at Plum Village summer retreats as well as starting several initiatives of her own. Over the past 20 years she has been exploring how to relate with children through her own experiences as a mother and as a coach for other parents.
