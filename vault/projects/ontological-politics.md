## Description

**An integral politics grounded in the nature of being for human beings.**

**Any social or political envisioning is constrained by an invisible frame**: by the implicit values and views on which it is created, most importantly its view of the nature of human beings.

If we are to rediscover our political imagination we need to go back to basics. **And a big vision socially and politically must begins with a vision for the “Being” of human beings.**
