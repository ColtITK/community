How do we bring about the shifts in being, culture and systems necessary to transform our social paradigm, and steer humanity and the planet into a flourishing future?

Here at Life Itself, we engage in many different projects. Some are experiments, others stand alone works, and others are ongoing explorations. All are designed to create a wiser, weller world. Our projects fall under two broad themes:

### Pioneering Community Living

At the core of what we do is the thesis that community living is key to embodying true transformation of ourselves and society.

Why is community living so important? Because we need to combine inner transformation and outer development. This is difficult, but living in a conscious community makes it easier. You have mutual support, accountability, responsibility, connection.

This is why we dedicate ourselves to creating pathways and providing tools for people to live in intentional communities.

Examples: [[projects/hubs |Co-living Hubs]], [[projects/embodying-collective-transformation |Transformational Community Residencies]]

### Transforming the Narrative

We are undergoing one of the greatest paradigm shifts in history. At itâ€™s foundations this shift requires a new way of being and new ways of doing.

Our work brings inner transformation out of the domain of the purely spiritual, and seeks to cement it as a pillar of social change that works for all. We use rigorous enquiry and sensemaking to better understand how we can make this paradigm shift a positive transformation for society.
