## *Talking about the big picture while staying grounded*

## Overview

### When?

5th April - 2nd May 2023

### What?

It is a time for big conversations as the recent upsurge in podcasting shows, because the long-standing feeling that the structure of our societies is a settled matter, has melted away. [Life Itself Praxis Hub](vault/hubs/bergerac) in Bergerac France provides the ideal environment to go deep on these questions. This means creating a beautiful and cooperative emotional environment where the emotions that drive our thoughts are welcomed with curiosity and compassion. It means balancing the intellectual with the embodied, with cooking and cleaning together, and group activities. It means using appropriate modes of discussion including collaborative brainstorming, bohmian dialogue, and sharp but respectful and principled debate (avoiding sophistry at all times.) 

### How?

We will set the big questions together, and the rules. The important principles that will be used are: 

* Building understanding together rather than competing to be in the right.
* Listening deeply and responding to what people actually say, steelmanning not strawmanning.
* Respect for the importance of the intellect, and humility about its limits.
* An ideal of free discussion between skilled conversationalists, who do not need to be bound by rules because of their grace and skill, and a pragmatic acceptance that rules are often helpful because none of us are perfectly graceful or skillful.
* Experimenting with various methods of discussion.

Some examples of world saving questions are below. Which ones we explore will be negotiated among participants.

* How do we address polarisation? 
* How can we address global warming? 
* How can we promote recognition of the value of all life? 
* How do we address the massive economic equality, racism and historical injustices that are rife across the globe? 
* How can education be done much better?
* How can societies be happier and live in harmony with each other? 
* What is consciousness and will changing attitudes towards it change civilisation?

### Facilitators

The residency will be faciliated by Life Itself co-founder, Liam Kavanagh and Victoria Wilding.

## Context

Until quite recently questions about how to change our societies for the better, how to balance incentives for economic productivity and education, and bringing greater justice to the world were often greeted with irony. For many discussions of such questions is an idle or adolescent attempt to “save the world” the most relevant question was simply: “how do I get by?”

On the other hand, understanding the big picture was considered, according to the foundational idea of democratic(-ish) society, to be the responsibility of the citizens who steer a society together. Our inability to understand our current malaise, and feeling of impending civilisation collapse is, then, intimately related to our restricted sense of practicality.

The prevailing ironic attitude towards big questions is perhaps a measure of the political cynicism that characterises what is called “the age of postmodernity.” For decades the Western world’s economic and political order went mostly unchallenged in public discussion, and to do so was often to arouse suspicion of being impractically utopian, or a dreaded communist. To entertain these questions became the privilege mainly of students and an elite few. In recent years, the possibility of a fundamentally different world, either better or worse than what we’ve known has come to feel much more real and the big questions are important again. 

The point of this residency is not to come away with the answers but to give participants the experience of really going to big questions together. Without a celebrity leader, neither rejecting expertise nor slavishly submitting to it.

Arguments go around and around in circles without ending up anywhere for a few reasons. One reason is that it is simply hard to come up with answers to these big questions, but it is equally true that often, the answers are simply not what we want to hear. They are more complicated and intricate; they do not give us easy simple magic bullet solutions. 

### The principles of this residency

#### We will respect the importance of the intellect, while also trying to be pragmatic and humble.

* Accepting the importance of “the life of the mind”, even if it is exaggerated in our culture.
* Asking questions that matter to the joy and suffering of living beings.
* Realising that thinking about big questions should be a responsibility in a democratic society, even if it is in practice a privilege accorded to few. (see below for more on these points)
* Not being ashamed of big words and complex ideas, while not being indulgent.
* Accepting that intellectual indulgence is something real, but that throwing this or related terms around has a chilling effect.
* Refraining from long lectures about anyone’s superior practicality.

#### We will do our utmost to have discussions that are really about *getting somewhere together* rather than scoring points. 

* Respond to things that others actually say, rather than what we would like them to have said, so that we can have a devastating argument.
* Making sure we understand thoughts correctly, before contradicting them. 
* Having good taste about when we interrupt one another.
	* For example, somebody may “go on” too much. There’s no right answer about when to interrupt them, but there is good taste and bad taste. 
* Assuming that others mean the smartest things that they might mean, given the inevitably manifold interpretations of their words. (steelmanning)
* Appreciating one anothers contributions, and diverse perspectives, especially their civility and even-handedness.

#### Having an ideal of free discussion between skilled conversationalists, who do not need to be bound by rules because of their grace and skill, while accepting that rules are often helpful because none of us are perfectly graceful or skillful.

#### Experimenting with various methods of discussion:

* Bohmian dialogue where participants speak with mindfulness is one tool we will use.
* So is good old fashioned civil “good faith” debate and discussion where sides promote opposing views but with respect, rather than adversariality.


We’ve all been there: the conversation turns to the big picture, what a wonderful world we could have if we could just set our mind to it? Why does the better world we imagine elude us? Why can’t we make it like this? Why is our society seemingly in disarray? The questions come fast and furious.
