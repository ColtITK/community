There will be plenty of Open Spaces for residents to learn, practice and share skills with one another. The residency includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects (35-40h/week).
- **How much ?** around 1400 for accommodation, food, training and practices.

## "Setting the World to Rights Residency", April-May 2023

- **When:** April 5th - May 2nd 2023
- **What:** A one month residency to focus on having exceptional big picture discussions. (The kind of discussions that draw the comment “You’re setting the world to rights!” Questions like: How do we address polarisation? How can we address global warming? How do we address the massive economic equality, racism and historical injustices that are rife across the globe? We won’t answer these questions, but we will do our utmost to have discussions that are really about *getting somewhere together* rather than scoring points. We will joyfully take up the neglected responsibility of citizens in a democracy, rather than a parlour game or indulgence
- **How much:** Dependent on rooming (around €1100 for accommodation, food, facilitation and practices)
- **Facilitator:** [Liam Kavanagh](https://www.liamkavanagh.me/), [Victoria Wilding](https://www.victoriawilding.com/)

## Ouroboros Residency, May 2023

- **When:** 7th – 28th May 2023
- **What:** Considering the question 'What is the posture beyond internalised patriarchy?' 
The patriarchal structures and systems built over centuries have been internalised by all humans.
The unfortunate reality is the values and expectations of these patriarchal structures and systems have resulted in a posture where we as a species have sacrificed our capacity and yearning for greater agency, connection and engagement at all levels of society.
The seismic shifts we need to effectively respond to this meta-crisis, are systemic, global, and urgent, requiring us to access our intuition, creativity and imagination. cThe Ouroboros residencies will be dedicated to creating the conditions to strengthen our connection to these innate capacities by bringing our attention moment by moment to our “posture” and noticing how it in-forms us.
- **How:** Creating the conditions for the posture to arise 
- **How many:** 12 participants max 
- **How much:** From 750 to 1350 euros
- **Facilitators:** Valérie Duvauchelle, Victoria Wilding, Lauren Uba
