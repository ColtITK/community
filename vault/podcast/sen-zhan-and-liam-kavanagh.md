This week we're excited to be sharing an episode from our partner podcast, The Life Itself Hubcast, hosted and produced by Sen Zhan.

In this episode, Sen sits down with co-founder of Life Itself, Liam Kavanagh. Their conversation explores community, the notion of a "wiser world", perspectives from Tanzania, and Liam's book Collective Wisdom and Beyond. They finish with a Lightning Round on "The Hub Knock Life" - an up-close and personal sharing of day-to-day life as a resident in the Bergerac Hub.
