In December 2021 we held a [Community Hangout](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/11/30/community-hangout-december-2021) event, featuring Esther Montmany as a special guest. Esther has spent more than 20 years developing a unique approach to conscious parenting and education. She has worked with Mauricio and Rebecca Wild at their legendary school in Ecuador and led the children's program at Plum Village summer retreats as well as starting several initiatives of her own. 

During her session, Esther shared concrete examples of how to deal with certain situations eg: refusing to eat certain food, jealousy between brother and sister, sleep etc â€“ and the broader principles of conscious parenting and education behind them.

## About Esther

Esther has spent more than twenty years learning and sharing about the conditions that help humans beings to grow from their natural inner wisdom, rooted in themselves and in harmony with others. She has travelled around the world seeking cultures and communities in order to enrich her vision for the wiser nurturing and education of children.

The source that has helped her the most have been the projects that Mauricio and Rebeca Wild created in Ecuador, where she trained for several years over the course of several long-term visits.

She has started her own school and her own community and now she is coaching families, teacher's and organizing conscious parenting retreats as well as retreats for adults in nature.

The past six years she has also been deeply involved in the children's program for the summer retreat in Plum Village where she has also been in charge for the school for parents.

Finally, she is the mother of two wonderful children of twenty-one and nineteen.
