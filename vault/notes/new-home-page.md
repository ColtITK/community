In the past four decades, a confirmation and expansion of wisdom traditions
by scientific rigor has converged with an ever deepening polycrisis.

There has never been a more important time to “grow up”, both personally and collectively. A
 paradigm shift is underway and we all have a part to play. 

The big question is…. how? 

Life itself is a home for people who are dedicated to rigorous enquiry a
nd deliberate action for inner growth and cultural evolution.

Inspired by integral theory, zen buddhism and other key concepts, we cultivate these ideas and 
apply them to life itself, through deliberately developmental programs and community building.
