## Overview

Blog posts are currently our primary form of content created for our audience. In 2021 almost 7% of website traffic came from a [single blog post](https://lifeitself.us/2020/05/12/qi-gong-the-eight-precious-exercises/) and 3.5% [from another](https://lifeitself.us/2018/05/01/mcgilchrist-master-and-his-emissary-notes/), but after that traffic to the blog is almost non-existent. 

The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that more blog posts get seen more times, such that we increase our website traffic and also expose more people to the fantastic insights of Life Itself.

## How to upload a blog

### Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through adding a new blog to the website. (Note that there was an error in the instructions at 09:10 so a correction video was recorded and added in to replace the incorrect section.

### Written guide

Once you've navigated to the right place, uploading a blog is the same as adding any other webpage. Go the vault/blog folder in the community repo. Then create the new page for the blog in date structured folders eg. vault -> blog -> 2023 -> 01 -> 16 -> blog-file-name.md. For the frontmattter fields you can have a look at any of the other blog posts within that folder. Once added commit the new file as you usually would. See the [contributors' guide](https://web3.lifeitself.org/meta/editing) on the Web3 site for a guide on how to add/edit a page. Adding to the Life Itself website is exactly the same, just remember it's the Community repo for the Life Itself site (not the web3 repo).


## Overall layout

### Heading structure

Headings throughout the article are really important for SEO ranking and also for keeping readers interested and engaged. A general rule of thumb is that no section of writing should be more than 300 words without a heading or subheading.  


#### Key points

* Structure headings correctly. The title should be H1, primary heading H2, subheadings H3 and so on. It is important to keep the structure (e.g. Don’t use H2 and then H4, without a H3). 
* Heading should be distributed through the article so no one section of writing is more than 300 words. 
* Titles should explain what the section of writing is about and contain the important key phrases of the article or that section in particular. 


### Table of contents

Once the heading structure is effectively in place, adding a table of contents makes the article much more accessible. People can choose to skip to the sections that most inspire them, making for a better user experience and greater user retention. To make a table of contents in markdown, follow this template:

### Call to action

Always finish an article with a call to action. If someone gets to the end of an article they most likely want to read more. What should they read next? Tell them. And remember to link.


## Links

Linking back to other articles and pages on the website will help viewers navigate our website, but also search engine crawlers. Where possible try to add links to other articles or pages on the website. 


## Additional tasks

Once the article is published, to make it easy for the comms lead to share the article please add a short summary of the article to the [LI Content Mastersheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1M3nqhszdQDYZeSHPttAevfsr0u9x_irLit9S-oUSzO0/edit) under the tab “Blog Summaries”. **This makes it much easier to create content without having to spend extra time reading each article - the author knows best how to summarize the article.**
