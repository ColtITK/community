This page documents all the responsibilities held by the Life Itself Communications Assistant in 2022 and links out to resources on how to carry out these tasks.

## Responsibilities

### Social media

#### Twitter

For Twitter, we currently do ~ 1 hour of engagement per week which includes retweeting and quote tweeting of relevant content and targeted engagement such as commenting on posts and following people we think should follow us. 

In addition, we have been posting 1 high-quality thread per week, using Dickie Bushâ€™s method of composing a thread as guidance: [How to Write a Twitter Thread: The Complete Guide](https://www.ship30for30.com/post/how-to-write-a-twitter-thread).

For detailed information on an optimal use of Twitter (which is more than we have been doing - we scaled back due to limited time and resources) see this document: [A Life Itself Guide to Twitter Content Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tX1vm0UgWguSAGGvbA7R3KXAH6toAs6MAekCZS0WbI/edit#heading=h.kv3zojohyh6f).

#### Instagram

We have currently been posting 1 post every 2 weeks to Instagram. For details on posting to instagram, see [Publishing an Instagram Post](https://lifeitself.org/tao/communications/publishing-an-instagram-post).

### YouTube and Podcast 

For detailed instructions on how to produce and market YouTube and Podcast episodes, see [How to produce YouTube and podcast episodes](https://lifeitself.org/tao/communications/producing-a-podcast-episode-guide).

### Publishing Blogs

Blogs are published whenever we publish a new podcast/YouTube episode, before, during, and after residencies, and on other miscellaneous occasions. For details on how to publish a blog see [How to publish a blog](https://lifeitself.org/tao/communications/guide-to-uploading-blogs).

### Producing the monthly newsletter

For a tutorial on how to produce the monthly newsletter, see [How to produce the monthly newsletter](https://lifeitself.org/tao/communications/creating-the-monthly-newsletter)

### Email front door and connecting with other innitiatives

Every day, check the hello@lifeitself.org inbox. Respond to all, even if to let them know you are cc-ing in a different colleague.

Occasionally someone emails asking about the possibility of collaboration. Research who they are and what they do. Then, if their work does align and you think they could be a potential collaborator or pioneer, set up a call between them and yourself. Record the call. After the call, write up a brief for Rufus and create a github issue for him to read the brief and let you know how he wants to proceed with the person. For an example, see https://github.com/life-itself/community/issues/165 

### General website editing

For a comprehensive guide on how to make edits to the Life Itself website, see the [Web3 site Contributors' Guide](https://web3.lifeitself.org/meta/editing). Note that when the guide refers to the 'Web3 repo', for the Life Itself site it will instead be the community repo you should be using.
