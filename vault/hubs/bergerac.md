The Bergerac Hub offers opportunities to explore what it really means to live more consciously together.

The Hub is nestled near the River Dordogne and just a few minutes walk from Bergerac's beautiful town centre. A perfect location from which to enjoy both the glorious French countryside and the vibrant medieval town.

The Hub is used both as a Life Itself Praxis Hub and is available to other groups and communities to create their own retreats, workshops and residencies. If you are interested please [contact us](https://lifeitself.org/contact/).

## Overview

* **What?** Exploring the liminal space of collective and personal awakening to cultivate the disposition to be at ease with whatever comes and adjust to it .
* **How?** We believe in Community of practices, a frame which combines both a dynamic regenerative engagement for the collective and the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate daily practices (sitting, cooking, cleaning, circling) as an activation rather than an obligation (a service you give to your Self). Each residency is oriented around a key theme or question. More details can be found in the Section “[Upcoming residencies](https://lifeitself.org/upcoming-residencies-gatherings)”. 
* **Where?** The [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac, France](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac) (South West, in the Bordeaux wine region, 20 min from Plum Village)
* **For whom?** To all who wish to engage in practices: system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, painters, eco-dharmists, people ready to just be with what comes, good and bad. 
* **How can I participate?** Please apply online using the registration form within the corresponding residency page.
* **How much does it cost?** A typical stay costs between €800 (shared room) and €1,300 (premium double room) per month / per person, including food. Facilitation fees may apply for some residencies. Couples can share double bedrooms at a substantially reduced rate.

## The Bergerac Praxis Hub

The Bergerac Praxis hub is gathering groups and communities interested in radically committing, together, to be in kinship with the world as it is. We will respond to uncertainty together, with collective embodied practices that include deep attention to humble activities like breathing, creating living space, or preparing food together. 

Beyond the seemingly paradoxical nature of contemplative activism, we carry the intention of the ungraspable concept of a metamodern monastery. Our vision is to create a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world.

The Praxis Hub is a space devoted to the development and deepening of practices for an integrative response to our cultural situation. The Hub hosts residencies at the service of change agents. A laboratory to test and develop collective practices that can support our capacity to be together in this time of complexity, both individually and collectively.

The Hub is an experiential place that seeks to highlight the activation process resulting from community living. A proposal that aims to bring out another way of thinking and living in the world by questioning the relationship between the intimate and the collective along the question of alterity.

**We envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective wisdom.** 

**Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a receptive way of living, where deep listening informs us towards a transformation grounded in the values of curiosity, engagement and trust.**

## The Praxis residencies and gatherings 

We are running and hosting a series of [residencies and retreats](https://lifeitself.org/upcoming-residencies-gatherings) that are a spiritual cooking together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The residences open a space, a vacuum filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries, where we sit with our trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices with the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.

## The Praxis Lab 

The Bergerac Hub is a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world. We see this space as a place for **experimentation, exploration, and learning,** where people can engage in self-work, creative work, and spiritual practices within a supportive and structured framework. We believe that this framework, which combines elements of monastic and secular practices, can facilitate the development of a new paradigm of living and being, one that is more connected, embodied, and expansive. 

We envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective well-being, and explore the potential of these practices to shape the future of society. Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a metamodern, evolutionary way of living that is grounded in the values of interdependence, mindfulness, and compassion, and that has the potential to awaken and activate the full potential of individuals and communities.

For this purpose, the Praxis Lab will serve as a research space to collect data on the relations between spaces, structures, and practices, and make visible their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual effects. The Praxis Lab team will conduct scientific observations during residencies to document and define the inter-relational human technology that fosters a new way of engaging with the world. The focus is on documenting practices from a "how" perspective, studying how human technology can animate forgotten skills of creativity and adjustment. The team will investigate questions such as: what is required to act from a space beyond thinking, what inner movement does this activate, and what are the effects of this posture? They will also explore the concept of a space as a place of practice and how to document self-research in a reproducible way. 

Ultimately, the research conducted at the Praxis Lab at the Bergerac Hub aims to not only improve the well-being of individuals and communities, but also to contribute to the development of a more interconnected, compassionate and mindful society. Through documenting and studying the effects of our practices, we hope to inform and inspire others to create similar spaces and practices that can lead to systemic transformation.

## Common Principles

* **Engagement**  in daily collective practices: meditating, caring for the food and the house, and relating. 
* **Punctuality** so as not to encroach on the time of others. 
* **Benevolent food:** collective meals at the Praxis Hub are benevolent and plant-based, with the intention of fostering a different posture towards food. However, we invite each group to explore the complexity of their needs and make decisions collectively. 
* **Self responsibility:** the hub is a laboratory for collective experimentation.  Personal needs should be honored as long as they do not disrupt the collective.
* **Responsivity:** a relative capacity to meet the potential challenges that come with living together is valued. Support tools are available, but it should be noted that this is not a therapeutic space.
* **Respect for inanimate beings:** we consider the praxis hub to be a living being 
* **Concentration:** to support a mindful spirit, a non-alcohol policy is suggested during weekdays.

### Bedrooms

There are three types of bedroom: basic, standard, premium. Basic are still functional but are smaller and are not ensuite.

The Hub is a little over 1 hour 30 minutes from Bordeaux by car, around 2 hours 40 minutes from Toulouse, and a little under 5 hours from Lyon.

There is free parking right in front of the hub at Place Barbacane and alongside the riverside next to the house.

🚩 If you park in Place Barbacane itself you need to move your car out of there every Thursday night (by ~11pm) until Friday afternoon because of the market that takes place on Place Barbacane.

Alternative free parking can be found in the riverside and the public parking lot named  “Jean Barthé” (google maps), 3 min. walk from the hub.
