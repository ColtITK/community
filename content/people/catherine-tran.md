Catherine studied English at the University of Cambridge (UK) before completing a joint M.A. in Cultural Narratives at the University of Guelph (Canada), University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), and University of Perpignan (France) as an Erasmus Mundus scholar. During her masterâ€™s she explored the role that art and literature might play in cultivating ecological responsibility, and she's interested in what it means to be a responsible human being in a web of interspecies interdependence.
