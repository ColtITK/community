Valerie is a passionate advocate for activating new ways of being in the world. She believes that to live fully we need to allow for a radically different relationship to the world and to ourselves. 

Her specific interest is in the application of new ways of being in community and seeks to understand the invisible evolutionary impulses that occur when we do things together. 

She is a Tenzo cook in the Zen tradition and through her books, programs and retreats brings the universal teachings of this tradition into community living. She is most well known for the design and development of the Onboarding Process which bridges 20 years of learning in Zen temples with conscious community experience.
Her dedicated practice is to cultivate a posture of "being witness” in her life. 
She embodies the balance between deep commitment and spontaneous playfulness.  

Valérie is a pioneer within Life Itself and co-curator of the Bergerac Praxis Hub.
