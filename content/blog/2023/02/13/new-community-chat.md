We've started a new community chat space on Whatsapp! 

In our survey last year, we asked what people needed in their lives that they currently didn't have. 

The answers accrued from that survey gave us a few key things that people were looking for: 
- Networking opportunities
- Job, coliving & event listings
- Real-time discussions and connection

Our solution to this is to use Whatsapp new community feature to create a community chat space.

## Why Whatsapp?

Whatsapp has its downsides and over the last few years people have been transitioning away from Whatsapp. 

That said, it is still the most popular messaging app and therefore the most accessible. We didn't want to start up on a lesser used app where you would have to go out of your way to find the community chat.

The latest community feature from Whatsapp also fits perfectly for what we want. 

## So what will I find in the community chat? 

We're glad you asked! The community chat is split up into various groups to keep things focussed in each one:
- [Welcome chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CYHqMM6bc0OKTHjTt5rdkR) - Here you can give a detailed introduction about yourself. This group will also be useful for people interested in networking to find people they want to network with.
- [General chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JNJCTZugNQn1fq89xbHtfA) - The anything goes area to spark discussion, share your favorite book, or ask a question.
- [Jobs board](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JEhLN7qF8aG40zBjmEWUTG) - Listings for open positions and people looking for work
- [Coliving board](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DycZceubrTzI1DHKHZr5sw) - For those looking for a new living situation, in particular conscious coliving. Lear more about conscious coliving in the article, [what is conscious coliving?](../../../2021/07/14/what-is-conscious-coliving) 
- [Events board](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B6MNLYMsjutDXJX7F0mDQ4) - Event listings for in-person and online events of any shape and size. 

## This is just the beginning

This community chat is simply a launchpad to spark vital discussion and nourishing interconnection between everyone working to create a wiser, weller world. 

The possibility to expand to new groups is right there. So, if you have an idea for a new group and would like to act as group leader go ahead and do it. 

Let's go set the world to rights!
