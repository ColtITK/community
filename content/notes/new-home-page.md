## 5w summary

In the past four decades, a confirmation and expansion of wisdom traditions by scientific rigor has converged with an ever deepening polycrisis.

There has never been a more important time to “grow up”, both personally and collectively. A paradigm shift is underway and we all have a part to play. 

The big question is…. how? 

Life itself is a home for people who are dedicated to rigorous enquiry and deliberate action for inner growth and cultural evolution.

Inspired by integral theory, zen buddhism and other key concepts, we cultivate these ideas and apply them to life itself, through deliberately developmental programs and community building.

## Key Ideas

![[../assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-7.png]]
### [[../blog/2022/05/21/crypto-can-these-financial-perpetual-motion-machines-work |Crypto: Can These Financial Perpetual Motion Machines Work]]
The current crypto-economy is booming. A huge amount of money is circulating, and on the surface it appears many are gaining huge returns on their crypto investments. As one now infamous piece of crypto popular culture puts it, the line just keeps going up. Much of the rhetoric in the crypto-sphere gives a sense of a perpetual motion machine, generating self-fuelled growth which will last forever. The key question is, can it?

![[../assets/images/Blog-Feature-Images-27.jpg]]
### [[../blog/2022/02/01/cultivating-an-emerging-paradigm |Cultivating An Emerging Paradigm]]
Humanity and the planet are at a critical point in history similar to major breakdown/breakthrough points of the past, most recently the transition to modernity in the Enlightenment. We risk civilizational collapse and we also have the possibility of a breakthrough. How do we facilitate the latter?

![[../assets/images/dsc_9971_sarah_hickson.jpg]]
### [[../blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis |Deliberately Developmental Spaces: A Key To Addressing The Metacrisis]]
In this time of metacrisis, development in individual and collective “being” is a top priority. But how do we achieve this? The short answer is we don’t know – evidence and theory in this area remains limited. Nevertheless, one promising approach is the creation of deliberately developmental spaces. This idea draws inspiration from a diverse set of sources including millenia old monastic traditions, the folk-schools of 19th-century Nordics as well as the varied experiments in intentional living more recently. In this piece we outline the key features of these spaces as well as some principles for their design and operation.

## Upcoming Residencies & Courses

### [[../setting-the-world-to-rights-residency |Setting The World To Rights Residency]]
_April 5th - May 2nd 2023_ with Liam Kavanagh & Victoria Wilding
This residency challenges this attitude, seeing big topic conversations as a crucial job of citizens in a democracy. It will feature emotionally aware dialogue about our societies’ greatest challenges and our part in responding to them.

### [[../ouroboros-residency |Ouroboros Residency]]
_May 13th - May 24th_ with Valerie Duvauchelle, Victoria Wilding & Lauren Uba
The Ouroboros residencies will be dedicated to creating the conditions to strengthen our connection to these innate capacities by bringing our attention moment by moment to our “posture” and noticing how it in-forms us. In the residencies we will consciously move beyond the transformational dynamic of being withness to create what we describe as an “in-formational” space.

## Our Story

Life Itself started under the name Art/Earth/Tech in 2015 when the co-founders came together under a shared vision to facilitate a wiser, weller world. The first hubs were set up during the early years in La Cheraille, Berlin and London and the team began hosting community gatherings and other events.
