This week we're honoured to be sharing an episode from our partner podcast, The Life Itself Hubcast, hosted and produced by Sen Zhan.

In this episode, Sen sits down with co-founder of Life Itself, Sylvie Shiwei Barbier. Their conversation explores Sylvie's Taiwanese French origins, the role of suffering and growth to home and belonging, and Life Itself and the Hubs. They finish with a Lightning Round on "The Hub Knock Life" - an up-close and personal sharing of day-to-day life as a resident in the Bergerac Hub.
