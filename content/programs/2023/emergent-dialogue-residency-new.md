### The Praxis Hub

The Bergerac Praxis Hub is gathering groups and communities interested in radically committing, together, to be in kinship with the world as it is. We will respond to uncertainty together, with collective embodied practices that include deep attention to humble activities like breathing, creating living space, or preparing food together. 

Beyond the seemingly paradoxical nature of contemplative activism, we carry the intention of the ungraspable concept of a metamodern monastery.

_Our vision is to create a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world._

### The Praxis Lab 

The  Praxis Lab is an evolutionary research space within the Praxis Hub aiming to define and document through scientific observations the ecologies of practices that foster a disposition of engaging differently in the world.

In particular through collecting data and studying the interrelations between spaces, structures and practices, it aims to make visible how the interplay/relational  identity between individuals and their environment (space, structure, practices) shapes their emotional, spiritual and intellectual disposition. 

The Ouroboros Residencies and Praxis Lab team will work together to identify, define and articulate how by focussing on the way we practice, i.e the collective “posture”, can catalyze an intentional state of receptivity, of being “in-formed” rather than, or as a premise of, being “trans-formed” into a collective field.
