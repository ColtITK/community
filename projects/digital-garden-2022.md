# Community Repo as forum + wiki x+ research notebook (digital garden / second brain) 

Idea: use this repository as notebook/wiki/forum and have that published online at e.g. forum.lifeitself.us or lifeitself.us/forum/

There are roughly two parts to this:

1. A structure for adding content, discussions etc
2. A way of publishing that online

## Job Stories

### Notebook

When I have notes on a book I want to be able to publish them somewhere so that others (and myself) can find them

When I have quick ideas or notes (incl e.g. a screenshot) I want to be able to store (and publish) them somewhere so I can find and link to them later

When creating notes or ideas or questions I want to be able to discuss them with others so that they get get refined or answered

### forum

When I have ideas or thoughts (relatively unformed) I want to share with others so that i can get input / feedback

When I want to learn more day to day about a community I want to have somewhere I can see what they are up to and thinking so that ...

When I am loosely associated

## Context

This community repository current houses a few things:

* Git repo itself
* Issues
* Discussions

Background:

* This repository was originally our (fairly inactive) "research" repository.
* We also used to have a forum powered by discourse.

## Analysis

New-fangled graph-oriented knowledge systems seem all the rage e.g. Roam and now a plethora of others Foam, Dendron, Obsidian, Athens Research etc etc (though seem incredibly similar to wikis ... but with block level linking ...)

Would be nice to use this and perhaps the zettelkasten methodology.

My recommendation would be Obsidian or Dendron I think. Dendron seems better than Foam.
